../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/001 - Rosetta Stone Ltd v Google Inc.txt, Background Provider of technology-based language learning products and services brought action alleging that internet search engine operator actively assisted third party advertisers to mislead consumers and misappropriated its trademarks by using trademarks as keyword triggers for paid advertisements and within title and text of paid advertisements on operators website. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Gerald Bruce Lee J. dismissed unjust enrichment claim 732 F.Supp.2d 628 and entered summary judgment in operators favor 730 F.Supp.2d 531. Provider appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Traxler Chief Judge held that  1 summary judgment on providers trademark infringement claim was not warranted  2 operators use of marks was not protected by functionality doctrine  3 summary judgment on providers contributory infringement claim was not warranted  4 operator was not liable for vicarious trademark infringement  5 operator was not unjustly enriched by its auctioning of trademarks and  6 summary judgment on providers trademark dilution claim was not warranted.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,To establish trademark infringement under Lanham Act plaintiff must prove that 1 it owns valid mark 2 defendant used mark in commerce and without plaintiffs authorization 3 defendant used mark or imitation of it in connection with sale offering for sale distribution or advertising of goods or services and 4 defendants use of mark is likely to confuse consumers. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,District courts failure to consider all nine traditional likelihood-of-confusion factors is not reversible error in ruling on trademark infringement claim especially when offending use of plaintiffs trademark is referential or nominative in nature however district court opting not to address given factor or group of factors should provide at least brief explanation of its reasons. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,When defendant creates association between its goods or services and plaintiffs mark strength of mark is relevant consideration in ruling on trademark infringement claim since encroachment upon strong mark is more likely to cause confusion. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Genuine issues of material fact as to whether internet search engine operators auctioning of marks owned by provider of technology-based language learning products and services as keyword triggers for links sponsored by third party advertisers was intended to produce confusion in minds of consumers about origin of goods or services in question and whether it in fact did so precluded summary judgment on providers trademark infringement claim against operator. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Anecdotal customer testimony internet search engine operators in-house studies and experts report were admissible as evidence of actual confusion for summary judgment purposes in trademark infringement action brought by provider of technology-based language learning products and services against operator that auctioned its marks to third party advertisers even though customers were aware that they were not purchasing directly from provider and there were only five instances of actual confusion out of more than 100000 impressions over six years where provider claimed that customers were confused as to goods sponsorship district court permitted only five actual confusion depositions and there was evidence of more than 260 other instances of actual confusion. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Presumption of likelihood of consumer confusion arises from intentional copying of plaintiffs trade dress or trademark by defendant.,Internet search engine operators use of marks owned by provider of technology-based language learning products and services as keyword triggers for links sponsored by third party advertisers was not protected by functionality doctrine from imposition of liability for trademark infringement under Lanham Act even if marks made operators product more useful providers use of its own mark was not essential for functioning of its language-learning products which would operate no differently if they were branded with another name. Lanham Act  2e5 32a 33b8 15 U.S.C.A.  1052e5 1114a 1115b8.,Product feature is functional and thus is not protected by Lanham Act if it is reason device works or it constitutes actual benefit that customer wishes to purchase as distinguished from assurance that particular entity made sponsored or endorsed product. Lanham Act  2e5 15 U.S.C.A.  1052e5.,Contributory infringement is judicially created doctrine that derives from common law of torts under which liability may be imposed upon those who facilitate or encourage trademark infringement. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,To establish contributory trademark infringement claim it is not enough to have general knowledge that some percentage of purchasers of product or service is using it to engage in infringing activities rather defendant must supply its product or service to identified individuals that it knows or has reason to know are engaging in trademark infringement. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,For there to be liability for contributory trademark infringement plaintiff must establish underlying direct infringement. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Genuine issue of material fact as to whether internet search engine operator continued to supply its keyword advertising services to known trademark infringers precluded summary judgment on contributory infringement claim brought against operator by provider of technology-based language learning products and services. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Liability for vicarious trademark infringement requires finding that defendant and infringer have apparent or actual partnership have authority to bind one another in transactions with third parties or exercise joint ownership or control over infringing product. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Internet search engine operator that auctioned keyword triggers for links sponsored to third party advertisers was not liable for vicarious trademark infringement under Lanham Act based on advertisers sales of counterfeit products where there was no evidence that operator acted jointly with any advertiser to control counterfeit products. Lanham Act  32a 15 U.S.C.A.  1114a.,Under Virginia law cause of action for unjust enrichment rests upon doctrine that a man shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at expense of another.,Under Virginia law to avoid unjust enrichment equity will effect contract implied in law requiring one who accepts and receives services of another to make reasonable compensation for those services.,Under Virginia law plaintiff asserting unjust enrichment must demonstrate that 1 he conferred benefit on defendant 2 defendant knew of benefit and should reasonably have expected to repay plaintiff and 3 defendant accepted or retained benefit without paying for its value.,Under Virginia law implied-in-fact contract is actual contract that was not reduced to writing but court infers existence of contract from parties conduct.,Under Virginia law to recover under contract implied-in-fact plaintiff must allege facts to raise implication that defendant promised to pay plaintiff for such benefit.,Under Virginia law concept of implied-in-law contract or quasi contract applies only when there is no actual contract or meeting of minds.,Under Virginia law internet search engine operator was not unjustly enriched by its auctioning of trademarks belonging to provider of technology-based language learning products and services as keyword triggers for links sponsored by third party advertisers where there was no evidence that operator should reasonably have expected to pay for use of marks in its keyword query process.,Trademark dilution is whittling away of established trademarks selling power and value through its unauthorized use by others. Lanham Act  43c1 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c1.,Fair use essentially amounts to affirmative defense against claim of trademark dilution. Lanham Act  43c3A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c3A.,To state prima facie dilution claim under Federal Trademark Dilution Act FTDA plaintiff must show that 1 plaintiff owns famous mark that is distinctive 2 defendant has commenced using mark in commerce that allegedly is diluting famous mark 3 similarity between defendants mark and famous mark gives rise to association between marks and 4 association is likely to impair famous marks distinctiveness or likely to harm famous marks reputation. Lanham Act  43c1 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c1.,Once famous marks owner establishes prima facie case of trademark dilution by blurring or tarnishment it falls to defendant to demonstrate that its use constituted fair use other than as designation of source for defendants own goods or services. Lanham Act  43c3A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c3A.,Defendant in trademark dilution action must show that its use of mark was in good faith in order to establish fair use defense under Federal Trademark Dilution Act FTDA. Lanham Act  43c3A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c3A.,Genuine issues of material fact as to whether internet search engine operators use of marks owned by provider of technology-based language learning products and services as keyword triggers for links sponsored by third party advertisers diluted providers marks and whether providers marks were famous when operator first permitted their use as keyword triggers precluded summary judgment on providers trademark dilution claim against operator. Lanham Act  43c1 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c1.,Defendants first diluting use of famous mark fixes time by which famousness is to be measured for purposes of Federal Trademark Dilution Act FTDA.

../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/005 - Perfect 10 Inc v Amazoncom Inc.txt, Background Copyright owner brought actions against operator of Internet search engine and Internet retailer for inter alia infringement of copyrighted images. Actions were consolidated. The United States District Court for the Central District of California A. Howard Matz J. 416 F.Supp.2d 828 entered preliminary injunction against some allegedly infringing conduct. Both owner and search engine operator appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Ikuta Circuit Judge held that  1 owner established prima facie case of direct infringement based on operators communication of thumbnail images  2 operators act of framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs was not display of owners works  3 operator did not distribute owners full-size images  4 operators display of thumbnail images of copyright owners photographs was fair use  5 operator substantially assisted third-party websites in distributing their infringing copies of photographs to a worldwide market and assisted worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials for purpose of owners contributory infringement claim  6 owner failed to show likelihood of success on its vicarious infringement claim and  7 owner was unlikely to succeed on merits of its direct infringement and vicarious infringement claims against Internet retailer.  Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded.  Opinion 487 F.3d 701 superseded. ,Where some of allegedly infringed images were registered district court was authorized to enter preliminary injunction covering both registered and unregistered works in owners copyright infringement action against Internet search engine operator and Internet retailer and Court of Appeals thus had jurisdiction over appeal from district courts decision and order. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Although registration is generally a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit for copyright infringement Copyright Act does not limit the remedies a court can grant rather the Copyright Act gives courts broad authority to issue injunctive relief. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Once a court has jurisdiction over an action for copyright infringement under provision of Copyright Act governing initiation of infringement actions the court may grant injunctive relief to restrain infringement of any copyright whether registered or unregistered. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Court of Appeals reviews the district courts grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.,District court must support a preliminary injunction with findings of fact which Court of Appeals reviews for clear error.,In reviewing grant or denial of preliminary injunction Court of Appeals reviews the district courts conclusions of law de novo.,Preliminary injunctive relief is available to a party who demonstrates either 1 a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or 2 that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.,In order to demonstrate its likely success on the merits the party moving for a preliminary injunction must necessarily demonstrate it will overcome defenses raised by the non-moving party this burden is correctly placed on the party seeking to demonstrate entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction at an early stage of the litigation before the defendant has had the opportunity to undertake extensive discovery or develop its defenses.,Because defendant in copyright infringement action bears burden of proving fair use once plaintiff moving for preliminary injunction has carried its burden of showing likelihood of success on merits burden shifts to defendant to show likelihood that its affirmative defense will succeed.,Congress enacted Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA provisions governing liability of online service providers to provide greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities. 17 U.S.C.A.  512.,Liability of online service providers for direct contributory or vicarious copyright infringement would be determined without reference to liability limitations set forth by Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA DMCA did not change copyright law but instead provided limitations of liability if provider was found to be liable under existing principles of law and claims against service providers were generally evaluated just as they would be in the non-online world. 17 U.S.C.A.  512.,Plaintiffs must satisfy two requirements to present a prima facie case of direct copyright infringement 1 they must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and 2 they must demonstrate that the alleged infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501a.,Even if a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of direct copyright infringement by showing ownership of the allegedly infringed material and that the alleged infringers violated at least one of the plaintiffs exclusive rights the defendant may avoid liability if it can establish that its use of the images is a fair use as set forth in the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 107 501a.,A photographic image is a work that is fixed in a tangible medium of expression for purposes of the Copyright Act when embodied that is stored in a computers server or hard disk or other storage device while the image stored in the computer is the copy of the work for purposes of copyright law. 17 U.S.C.A.  101.,Owner of copyrights for photographs established prima facie case of direct infringement of owners statutory right to display copyrighted works based on communication of thumbnail images of owners photographs by operator of Internet search engine which were stored on operators computers to search engine users in response to searches by such users. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 1065.,Internet search engine operators act of framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs on operators website did not constitute display of copies of such photographs within meaning of Copyright Act as would amount to direct infringement where full-size images were not stored on operators own computers but rather operator provided hypertext markup language HTML instructions that directed users browser to an unrelated website publishers computer which stored the full-size image. 17 U.S.C.A.  1065.,Copyright Act unlike the Trademark Act does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion. Trademark Act of 1946  321 15 U.S.C.A.  11141 17 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq.,Internet search engine operators act of framing in users search results in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs that were stored on third parties computers was not transmission or communication of performance or display of work to the public within meaning of Copyright Act operator transmitted or communicated only an address which directed a users browser to location where copy of full-size image was displayed and did not communicate a display of the work itself. 17 U.S.C.A.  101.,Under some circumstances more than one right protected by the Copyright Act must be infringed in order for an infringement claim to arise copyright infringement claimant must be able to claim infringement of its reproduction right in order to claim infringement of its right to prepare derivative works. 17 U.S.C.A.  106.,Cache used by operator of Internet search engine for storing copies of webpages organized and indexed by operator did not infringe the display or distribution rights belonging to owner of copyrighted photographs to extent that cached webpages in-linked to full-sized images of photographs that were stored on third-party website publishers computers regardless of whether cache copies directed users browser to third-party images that were no longer available on a particular publishers website it was publishers computer not operators computer that stored and displayed the infringing image. 17 U.S.C.A.  106.,Operator of Internet search engine did not distribute images of owners copyrighted photographs within meaning of Copyright Act by framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs on operators website in response to search and selection by user operator did not itself communicate full-size images to users computer but instead communicated hypertext markup language HTML instructions that told users browser where to find full-size images on a website publishers computer which then distributed copies of the works and because operator did not have collection of stored full-size images that it made available to the public it could not be deemed to distribute copies of the images. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 1063.,The fair use defense permits the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owners consent under certain situations the defense encourages and allows the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones thus providing a necessary counterbalance to the copyright laws goal of protecting creators work product. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Fair use doctrine to copyright infringement permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when on occasion it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Court must be flexible in applying a fair use analysis it is not to be simplified with bright-line rules for the copyright statute like the doctrine it recognizes calls for case-by-case analysis. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Four statutory fair use factors under the Copyright Act may not be treated in isolation one from another all are to be explored and the results weighed together in light of the purposes of copyright. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Purpose of copyright law is to promote the progress of science and useful arts and to serve the welfare of the public. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 1  8 cl. 8.,Central purpose of statutory fair use factor that looks at the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes is to determine whether and to what extent the new work is transformative. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,A work is transformative for purpose of inquiry into fair use factor that looks at the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work when the new work does not merely supersede the objects of the original creation but rather adds something new with a further purpose or different character altering the first with new expression meaning or message conversely if the new work supersedes the use of the original the use is likely not a fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work weighed in favor of defendant operator of Internet search engine in copyright infringement action brought by owner of copyrighted photographs based on operators display of thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users even if thumbnail images were derived from infringing third-party websites and showed the image in its entirety because operators use of works was highly transformative search engine provided social benefit by incorporating an original work into a new work namely an electronic reference tool and to extent that operators use was commercial and could supersede owners sale of images such use was not presently significant. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,The right of first publication is the authors right to control the first public appearance of his expression because this right encompasses the choices of when where and in what form first to publish a work an author exercises and exhausts this one-time right by publishing the work in any medium.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at nature of the copyrighted work weighed slightly in favor of plaintiff owner of copyrighted photographs in its action alleging copyright infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users images were creative even if they were primarily un-retouched but images were previously published when owner placed its images on the Internet for paid subscribers. 17 U.S.C.A.  1072.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole weighed in favor of neither party in action by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users use of entire image was reasonable in light of purpose of search engine. 17 U.S.C.A.  1073.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at effect of the allegedly infringing use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work favored neither party in action by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users operators use of images was highly transformative so there was no presumption of market harm and any potential harm to owners market was hypothetical. 17 U.S.C.A.  1074.,Presumption under fair use analysis that likelihood of market harm exists if the intended use of an image is for commercial gain does not arise when a work is transformative because market substitution is at least less certain and market harm may not be so readily inferred. 17 U.S.C.A.  1074.,Internet search engine operators display of thumbnail images of copyright owners photographs in response to user searches was fair use of copyrighted photographs operator put images to a use fundamentally different than use intended by owner thereby providing significant benefit to the public. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,One infringes a copyright contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.,Even if search engine users who linked to websites showing owners copyrighted photographs automatically made cache copies of full size images of the works and such action amounted to direct infringement of owners right of reproduction such automatic copying was fair use of copyrighted images such copying was a transformative use the cache copied no more than was necessary to assist the user in Internet use and the copying had no more than a minimal effect on owners rights while having a considerable public benefit. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Within the general rule that one infringes a copyright contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement there are two categories of contributory liability liability may be predicated on actively encouraging or inducing infringement through specific acts or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.,Contribution to copyright infringement must be intentional for liability to arise.,Contributory liability for copyright infringement is analyzed in light of rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law and common law principles establish that intent may be imputed.,An actor may be contributorily liable for intentionally encouraging direct copyright infringement if the actor knowingly takes steps that are substantially certain to result in such direct infringement.,A computer system operator can be held contributorily liable for copyright infringement if it has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system and can take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works yet continues to provide access to infringing works.,Operator of Internet search engine that indexed and organized third-party webpages substantially assisted third-party websites in distributing their infringing copies of copyrighted photographs to a worldwide market and assisted worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials for purpose of copyright owners contributory infringement claim even if operator did not undertake any substantial promotional or advertising efforts to encourage visits to infringing websites nor provide a significant revenue stream to the infringing websites operator could be held contributorily liable if it had knowledge that infringing images were available using its search engine could take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works and failed to take such steps.,To succeed in imposing vicarious liability for copyright infringement a plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from the direct infringement.,A defendant exercises control over a direct copyright infringer for purpose of imposing vicarious liability when he has both a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct as well as the practical ability to do so.,Owner of copyrighted photographs was not likely to succeed on its claim of vicarious copyright infringement by Internet search engine operator that provided to its users links to third-party websites that reproduced displayed and distributed unauthorized copies of owners images as required for preliminary injunction prohibiting such linking owner did not demonstrate likelihood of showing that operator had legal right to stop or limit direct infringement of third-party websites notwithstanding agreements through an advertising program permitting it to terminate an entitys participation in that program operator could not terminate third-party websites or block their ability to host and serve infringing full-size images on the Internet and operator lacked practical ability to police the infringing activities of third-party websites.,Although the lines between direct copyright infringement contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn in general contributory liability is based on the defendants failure to stop its own actions which facilitate third-party infringement while vicarious liability is based on the defendants failure to cause a third party to stop its directly infringing activities.,Internet retailers assertion that it had ended its relationship with operator of Internet search engine whereby retailer was allowed to in-line link to search results generated by search engine did not render moot copyright infringement action brought by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging that retailer provided links to third-party websites that displayed infringing images absent showing by retailer that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.,Owner of copyrighted photographs was unlikely to succeed on merits of its direct infringement and vicarious infringement claims against Internet retailer that provided by agreement with operator of Internet search engine search results to users that included links to third-party websites that contained infringing images as required for preliminary injunction prohibiting such conduct as retailer merely directed users to images stored on computers of operator or third parties and lacked ability to supervise infringing activity of operator or third parties.
../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/009 - Function Media LLC v Google Inc.txt, Background Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patent on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites. Parties consented to final disposition by magistrate judge. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Charles Everingham IV United States Magistrate Judge 2011 WL 4017953granted judgment for competitor in part after jury verdict in its favor in part. Patentee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Reyna Circuit Judge held that  1 patent did not provide any disclosure of structure for transmitting function and thus claim was invalid for failure to satisfy definiteness requirement  2 proving that person of ordinary skill could devise some method to perform transmitting function on invention was not sufficient to satisfy patent definiteness requirement  3 processing term in patent meant executing systematic sequence of mathematical or logical operations upon customized electronic advertisement to make it comply with presentation rules of Internet media venues  4 phrase publishing the electronic advertisement to one or more of the selected internet media venues in patent meant placing or making available the customized electronic advertisement within the framework of and at each internet media venue so that it is accessible by the end users consumers viewers or buyers  5 patentee was not required to object to its own testimony on point that was in accord with claim construction that it had proposed and that court had adopted  6 competitors arguments to jury about claim scope did not subvert jurys ability to fairly decide issues before it  7 jury verdicts regarding anticipation and patent invalidity were general verdicts not special verdicts and  8 argument that jury verdict was result of misapprehension of law specifically that claims could have one meaning for infringement and another for anticipation did not amount to clear showing of absolute absence of evidence to support jurys verdict of infringement as required for new trial.  Affirmed. ,Judicial notice may be taken of a decision from another court or agency at any stage of the proceeding even if it was not available to the lower court.,Patent claim construction and indefiniteness determinations are reviewed without deference.,If there is an error in patent claim construction the Court of Appeals independently construes the claim to determine its correct meaning and then determines if the facts presented at trial can support the appealed judgment.,Court of Appeals may affirm a jurys findings on patent infringement or validity issues if substantial evidence appears in the record supporting the jurys verdict and if correction of the errors in a jury instruction on claim construction would not have changed the result given the evidence presented.,In a patent case for issues not unique to patent law the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applies the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal otherwise would lie.,The Fifth Circuit reviews the denial of a motion for new trial brought on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence for abuse of discretion which means that the denial will be affirmed unless there is a clear showing of an absolute absence of evidence to support the jurys verdict.,Patent on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites did not provide any disclosure of structure for transmitting function and thus claim was invalid for failure to satisfy definiteness requirement where there was no specific algorithm disclosed in prose as mathematical formula in flow charts or otherwise although specification disclosed that structure behind function of transmitting was computer program that transmitted there was no explanation of how software performed transmission function. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,A patent specification must contain sufficient descriptive text by which a person of skill in the field of the invention would know and understand what structure corresponds to a means limitation. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,In patent cases involving a special purpose computer-implemented means-plus-function limitation in order to satisfy the definiteness requirement courts require that the specification disclose an algorithm for performing the claimed function and while the specification can express the algorithm in any understandable terms including as a mathematical formula in prose as a flow chart or in any other manner that provides sufficient structure simply disclosing software without providing some detail about the means to accomplish the function is not enough. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,Proof that person of ordinary skill could devise some method to perform transmitting function on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites was not sufficient to satisfy patent definiteness requirement and thus claim was invalid for failure to provide any disclosure of structure although patent contained flow charts charts did not disclose algorithm by which software performed transmission function. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,A patentee cannot avoid providing specificity as to structure on a means-plus-function limitation simply because someone of ordinary skill in the art would be able to devise a means to perform the claimed function to allow that form of claiming would allow the patentee to claim all possible means of achieving a function. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,Processing term in patent on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites meant executing systematic sequence of mathematical or logical operations upon customized electronic advertisement to make it comply with presentation rules of Internet media venues. 35 U.S.C.2006 Ed.  112.,The words of a patent claim generally are given their ordinary and customary meaning which is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention the claims do not stand alone but rather are part of a fully integrated written instrument consisting principally of a specification that concludes with the claims and for that reason the claims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part.,A party may not object to the courts decision to instruct the jury to apply the patent claim construction that it itself proposed.,A denial of summary judgment is not properly reviewable on an appeal from the final judgment entered after trial.,Phrase publishing the electronic advertisement to one or more of the selected internet media venues in patent on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites meant placing or making available the customized electronic advertisement within the framework of and at each internet media venue so that it is accessible by the end users consumers viewers or buyers addition of word at to definition correctly indicated that the ads must be sent to Internet media venues not to buyers.,The denial of a pretrial motion for summary judgment of noninfringement does not by itself show that the district court delegated claim construction to the jury this is especially true where the jury was instructed to apply the district courts claim constructions. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56 28 U.S.C.A.,Patentee was not required to object to its own testimony on point that was in accord with claim construction that it had proposed and that court had adopted to preserve issue for consideration on appeal of parties presentation of differing arguments at trial about what it meant to satisfy patent claim term since dispute had been brought to district courts attention during trial and court heard arguments from both sides.,Competitors arguments to jury about claim scope did not subvert jurys ability to fairly decide issues before it in action for infringement of patent on invention to facilitate advertising on multiple advertising outlets such as newspapers and websites although competitors arguments did not directly quote courts claim construction jury had been explicitly told by court to use only courts claim constructions and patentee had opportunity to object during trial or request limiting instructions but never did so.,Jury verdict of patent obviousness was general verdict not special verdict and thus argument that verdict was inconsistent had been waived for failure to object before jury had been dismissed portion of verdict in which jury applied facts to law on question of obviousness was clearly a general verdict because it was a legal question resting on underlying factual questions. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 49b 28 U.S.C.A.,Jury verdicts regarding anticipation and patent invalidity were general verdicts not special verdicts and thus argument that verdicts were irreconcilable because claims could not have one meaning for infringement and another for anticipation had been waived for failure to object before jury had been dismissed although jury had answered yes or no questions on each asserted claim and it technically was finding only facts questions on anticipation and validity required legal instruction application of legal principles and were more than simply written findings upon each issue of fact. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 49b 28 U.S.C.A.,In a patent case the law of the regional circuit is applied to determine whether an argument that the verdict is irreconcilable has been waived.,In the Fifth Circuit when the verdict is special a party need not object to the jurys inconsistent verdict before the jury is dismissed in order to avoid waiver.

../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/010 - Authors Guild v Google Inc.txt, Background Authors of published books under copyright brought putative class copyright infringement action against internet search engine claiming that search engines project which made digital copies of books submitted by major libraries and allowed the public to search the texts of the digitally copied books and see displays of snippets of text infringed on authors copyrights. Following rejection of proposed settlement 770 F.Supp.2d 666 and vacatur of class certification 721 F.3d 132 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Chin J. 954 F.Supp.2d 282 granted summary judgment to search engine under fair use doctrine. Authors appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Leval Circuit Judge held that  1 first fair use factor the purpose and character of the use supported finding search engines activities were protected by fair use  2 second fair use factor the nature of the copyrighted work supported finding search engines activities were protected by fair use  3 third fair use factor amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole supported finding search engines activities were protected by fair use  4 fourth fair use factor the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work supported finding search engines activities were protected by fair use  5 search engines activities did not usurp authors right to produce derivative works  6 there was no evidence that search engines creation of digital copies exposed the books to the risk that hackers might gain access and make the books widely available and  7 search engines provision of digital copies to participating libraries that already owned the books did not infringe on authors copyrights.  Affirmed. ,The ultimate goal of copyright is to expand public knowledge and understanding which copyright seeks to achieve by giving potential creators exclusive control over copying of their works thus giving them a financial incentive to create informative intellectually enriching works for public consumption.,While authors are undoubtedly important intended beneficiaries of copyright the ultimate primary intended beneficiary is the public whose access to knowledge copyright seeks to advance by providing rewards for authorship.,As fair use is an affirmative defense the party asserting fair use bears the burden of proof. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Transformative uses tend to favor a fair use finding because a transformative use is one that communicates something new and different from the original or expands its utility thus serving copyrights overall objective of contributing to public knowledge. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The word transformative cannot be taken too literally as a sufficient key to understanding the elements of fair use it is rather a suggestive symbol for a complex thought and does not mean that any and all changes made to an authors original text will necessarily support a finding of fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the transformative purpose factor for fair use the would-be fair user of anothers work must have justification for the taking. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the transformative purpose factor for fair use a secondary author is not necessarily at liberty to make wholesale takings of the original authors expression merely because of how well the original authors expression would convey the secondary authors different message. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Among the best recognized justifications for copying from anothers work under the transformative purpose factor of fair use is to provide comment on it or criticism of it. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Internet search engines making of a digital copy of copyrighted books for the purpose of enabling a search for identification of books containing a term of interest to the searcher was a highly transformative purpose thus supporting finding that search engines activities constituted fair use even though search engine allowed searchers to read snippets from the book searched and search engine was a profit-motivated company where the result of a word search was different in purpose character expression meaning and message from the page and the book from which it was drawn and the snippets were designed to show a searcher just enough context surrounding the searched term to help evaluate whether the book fell within the scope of interest without revealing so much as to threaten the authors copyright interests. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,While the copyright does not protect facts or ideas set forth in a work it does protect that authors manner of expressing those facts and ideas.,To the extent that the nature of the original copyrighted work necessarily combines with the purpose and character of the secondary work to permit assessment of whether the secondary work uses the original in a transformative manner the factor favored finding that internet search engines making of a digital copy of copyrighted books for the purpose of enabling a search for identification of books containing a term of interest to the searcher constituted fair use not simply because the copyrighted works were factual but because the secondary use transformatively provided valuable information about the original rather than replicating protected expression in a manner that provided a meaningful substitute for the original. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,A finding of fair use is more likely when small amounts or less important passages are copied than when the copying is extensive or encompasses the most important parts of the original. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The amount and substantiality of the portion used by internet search engine in making of a digital copy of copyrighted books for the purpose of enabling a search for identification of books containing a term of interest to the searcher in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole supported finding that search engines activities constituted fair use even though search engine made an unauthorized copy of the entire copyrighted books and allowed searchers to read snippets from the book searched where the digital copy of books were not publicly available a complete copy was required to enable search functions to reveal limited important information about the books and search engine implemented several protections that substantially prevented its results from serving as an effectively competing substitute for copyrighted books. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The fourth fair use factor the effect of the copying use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work focuses on whether the copy brings to the marketplace a competing substitute for the original or its derivative so as to deprive the rights holder of significant revenues because of the likelihood that potential purchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference to the original. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Because copyright is a commercial doctrine whose objective is to stimulate creativity among potential authors by enabling them to earn money from their creations the fourth fair use factor the effect of the copying use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work is of great importance in making a fair use assessment. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The effect of internet search engines making of a digital copy of copyrighted books for the purpose of enabling a search for identification of books containing a term of interest to the searcher upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work supported finding that search engines activities constituted fair use even though search engines provision of snippets from the books searched could cause some loss of sales where the normal purchase price of a book was relatively low in relation to the cost of manpower needed to obtain an arbitrary assortment of randomly scattered snippets and the provision of snippets was unlikely to satisfy a searchers interest in the protected aspects of an authors work. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Internet search engines making of a digital copy of copyrighted books for the purpose of enabling a search for identification of books containing a term of interest to the searcher did not usurp authors right to produce derivative works as the copyright protection of authors books did not include an exclusive derivative right to supply such information through query of a digitized copy. 17 U.S.C.A.  1062.,If in the course of making an arguable fair use of a copyrighted work a secondary user unreasonably exposed the rights holder to destruction of the value of the copyright resulting from the publics opportunity to employ the secondary use as a substitute for purchase of the original even though this was not the intent of the secondary user this might well furnish a substantial rebuttal to the secondary users claim of fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,There was no evidence that internet search engines storage of its digitized copies of copyrighted books exposed the books to the risk that hackers might gain access and make the books widely available thus destroying the value of the copyrights as would weigh against finding the copying protected by fair use where the digital copies were stored on computers walled off from public internet access and protected by the same impressive security measures used by the search engine to protect its own confidential information. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Internet search engines creation for each library of a digital copy of that librarys already-owned book in order to permit that library to make fair use through provision of digital searches did not infringe on authors copyrights to their books even if the provision of copies to libraries created possibility that libraries might mishandle their digital copies where the librarys own creation of a digital copy to enable its provision of fair use digital searches would not have constituted infringement and each librarys contract with search engine committed the library to use its digital copy only in a manner consistent with the copyright law and to take precautions to prevent dissemination of their digital copies to the public at large. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.

the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA safe harbor the difference between actual and red flag knowledge is not between specific and generalized knowledge but instead between a subjective and an objective standard in other words the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or subjectively knew of specific infringement while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement objectively obvious to a reasonable person. 17 U.S.C.A.  512c1Aii.,Genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether online service provider had actual knowledge of specific infringing activity or was at least aware of facts or circumstances from which specific infringing activity was apparent precluding summary judgment on issue of whether provider was entitled to Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA safe harbor. 17 U.S.C.A.  512c1A Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56a 28 U.S.C.A.,Survey evidence indicating that 7580 of all streams from online service provider contained copyrighted material and other evidence estimating that more than 60 of providers content was premium copyrighted content and that only 10 of premium content was authorized which suggested that provider was conscious that significant quantities of material on providers website was infringing was insufficient standing alone to show whether provider actually knew or was aware of facts or circumstances that would indicate existence of particular instances of infringement and thus was not entitled to Digital Millennium Copyright

the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA dictates a departure from the common law vicarious liability standard accordingly the right and ability to control infringing activity requires something more than the ability to remove or block access to materials posted on a service providers website. 17 U.S.C.A.  512c1B.,Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA by reason of safe harbor covered more than

../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/140 - In re Google Inc Cookie Placement Consumer Privacy Litigation.txt, Background Internet users brought actions against internet advertising providers alleging that providers placed tracking cookies on users browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers and asserting claims for violation of the federal Wiretap Act the Stored Communications Act SCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act CFFA and for privacy claims and various statutory violations under California law. After the actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation 867 F.Supp.2d 1356 the United States District Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson J. 988 F.Supp.2d 434 granted providers motion to dismiss. Users appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Fuentes Circuit Judge held that  1 users adequately pled that providers collected content under Wiretap Act  2 Wiretap Acts party exception applied  3 providers alleged conduct did not implicate protected facility under the SCA  4 users failed to adequately plead loss in support of CFAA claim  5 users stated privacy claims under California Constitution and tort law  6 users failed to state claim for violation of California Invasion of Privacy Act CIPA and  7 users failed to state claim under California Legal Remedies Act CLRA.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,If plaintiffs do not possess Article III standing both the district court and the Court of Appeals lack subject matter jurisdiction to address the merits of the plaintiffs case. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,In assessing injury in fact as required for Article III standing court looks for an invasion which is 1 concrete and particularized and 2 actual or imminent not conjectural or hypothetical. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,Though an injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way to constitute an injury in fact this standard does not demand that a plaintiff suffer any particular type of harm to have Article III standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,A plaintiff need not show actual monetary loss to demonstrate an injury of fact as required for Article III standing rather the actual or threatened injury required by Article III may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights the invasion of which creates standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,Internet users demonstrated injury in fact sufficient to establish Article III standing to bring action against internet advertising providers users alleged that providers in the course of serving advertisements to the users personal web browsers circumvented their browsers cookie blockers and implanted tracking cookies on their personal computers in violation of state and federal law. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,Internet users adequately pled that alleged scheme whereby internet advertising providers placed tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers involved the collection of content as required to state claim under the Wiretap Act users alleged that through the cookies providers acquired and tracked the universal resource locators URL they visited and URLs were not merely routing information as highly detailed URLs could reveal a users search terms or the particular piece of content that a user viewed. 18 U.S.C.A.  25108.,Internet users allegations indicated that internet advertising providers that allegedly placed tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers were the intended recipients of electronic transmissions underlying users Wiretap Act claims and thus users failed to state claim against providers under the Act allegations indicated that providers acquired users internet history information by way of GET requests sent by users browsers directly to the providers when users visited websites and the tracking cookies merely enabled providers to associate that information with particular users and did not independently acquire any information. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,Court of Appeals may affirm a district courts judgment on grounds other than those considered by the district court itself.,Court of Appeals could consider argument that internet users failed to state Wiretap Act claim against internet advertising providers because providers were intended recipients of electronic transmissions at issue even though district court did not address the issue and providers failed to raise the issue in form of a cross-appeal because whether the users stated a claim was a matter of law to be determined from the face of their complaint. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,Internet advertising providers alleged conduct in inducing internet users to send electronic communications to providers through deceitful circumvention of users cookie blockers did not affect providers status as parties to the communications that could not be held liable for violation of the Wiretap Act there was no statutory language indicating that the Acts party exception excluded intended recipients of communications who procured their entrance to a conversation through a fraud in the inducement and legislative history indicated that absence of an equitable exception was intended. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,In context of exception to Wiretap Act liability for persons who are parties to the intercepted communication a party to a conservation is one who takes part in the conversation. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,Internet advertising providers alleged conduct in placing tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers did not fall within criminal-tortious purpose exception to Wiretap Act section providing that parties to a communication could not be held liable under the Act exception was not triggered when the tortious conduct was the alleged wiretapping itself and while the conduct may have violated California laws related to intrusion upon seclusion intrusion upon seclusion was a tort that occurred through the act of interception itself and there were no allegations of criminal or tortious use of the acquired internet histories. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,To survive a motion to dismiss a plaintiff bringing a Wiretap Act claim against a defendant who was a party to the communication underlying the claim must plead sufficient facts to support an inference that the defendant intercepted the communication for the purpose of a tortious or criminal act that is independent of the intentional act of recording. 18 U.S.C.A.  25112d.,Internet advertising providers alleged conduct in placing tracking cookies on internet users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers did not implicate a protected facility within meaning of the Stored Communications Act SCA and thus was not actionable under the SCA although SCA did not define facility its definitions of electronic communication service and electronic storage indicated that the SCA was aimed at third party service providers not personal computers and a broad plain language definition of facility was inappropriate given that SCA and its legislative history showed specific Congressional intent to deal with the particular problem of private communications in network service providers possession. 18 U.S.C.A.  251015 2701.,Internet users failed to adequately plead that they suffered damage or loss as a result of alleged scheme whereby internet advertising providers placed tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers as required to state claim under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act CFAA although users plausibly alleged a market for internet history information that could be complied by cookies they alleged no facts suggesting that they ever participated or intended to participate in such a market or that the providers prevented them from capturing the full value of their internet usage information for themselves. 18 U.S.C.A.  1030a2C e8 11 g.,Under California law a privacy violation based on the common law tort of intrusion has two elements first the defendant must intentionally intrude into a place conversation or matter as to which the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy and second the intrusion must occur in a manner highly offensive to a reasonable person.,Under California law in order for a defendant to intentionally intrude into a place conversation or matter as to which the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy as required for a privacy violation based on the common law tort of intrusion the defendant must have penetrated some zone of physical or sensory privacy or obtained unwanted access to data by electronic or other covert means in violation of the law or social norms.,To prevail on claim of violation of right to privacy under the California Constitution a plaintiff must possess a legally protected privacy interest the plaintiffs expectations of privacy must be reasonable and the plaintiff must show that the intrusion is so serious in nature scope and actual or potential impact as to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms. Wests Ann.Cal. Const. Art. 1  1.,Dual inquiry performed by California courts when presented with parallel privacy claims under tort law and the California Constitution considers 1 the nature of any intrusion upon reasonable expectations of privacy and 2 the offensiveness or seriousness of the intrusion including any justification and other relevant interests. Wests Ann.Cal. Const. Art. 1  1.,In evaluating the offensiveness of an invasion of privacy in context of parallel privacy claims under tort law and the California Constitution court is to consider pragmatic policy concerns such that no cause of action will lie for accidental misguided or excusable acts of overstepping upon legitimate privacy rights. Wests Ann.Cal. Const. Art. 1  1.,Internet users alleged that internet advertising providers alleged conduct in placing tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers intruded upon users reasonable expectations of privacy as required to state parallel privacy claims under California tort law and the California Constitution while a sophisticated internet user may have known that in browsing the internet her universal resource locator URL information was sent to provider such a user would also reasonably expect that an activated cookie blocker meant her URL queries would not be associated with each other due to cookies. Wests Ann.Cal. Const. Art. 1  1.,Internet users sufficiently alleged that internet advertising providers alleged conduct in placing tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers was highly offensive or an egregious breach of social norms as required to state parallel privacy claims under California tort law and the California Constitution provider not only contravened the cookie blockers but publicly held itself out as respecting them the conduct touched untold millions of internet users only surfaced because of independent media research and was of indefinite duration and California and federal agencies penalized provider for the conduct alleged in users complaint. Wests Ann.Cal. Const. Art. 1  1.,The California Invasion of Privacy Act CIPA broadly prohibits the interception of wire communications and disclosure of the contents of such intercepted communications. Wests Ann.Cal.Penal Code  631a.,Internet users could not state claim against internet advertising provider for violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act CIPA based on providers alleged conduct in placing tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers CIPA was aimed only at eavesdropping or the secret monitoring of conversations by third parties and provider was itself a party to all the electronic transmissions that were the bases of the users claim. Wests Ann.Cal.Penal Code  631a.,Internet users failed to allege that a sale of services occurred as a result of alleged scheme whereby internet advertising provider placed tracking cookies on users web browsers in contravention of browsers cookie blockers as required to state claim under the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act CLRA despite argument that forced sale occurred whereby users exchanged trackable internet history information for advertisements delivered to their browsers definition of sale was not so expansive as to include transactions based on non-tangible forms of payment.

Affirmed.  Watford Circuit Judge filed opinion concurring in the judgment.  Kozinski Circuit Judge filed dissenting opinion. ,A district court order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.,A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show that 1 she is likely to succeed on the merits 2 she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief 3 the balance of equities tips in her favor and 4 an injunction is in the public interest.,Because it is a threshold inquiry in determining entitlement to preliminary injunction when a plaintiff has failed to show the likelihood of success on the merits Court of Appeals need not consider the remaining preliminary injunction elements.,Preliminary injunction is treated as a mandatory injunction if the relief sought orders a responsible party to take action.,A mandatory injunction goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite and is particularly disfavored.,A district court should deny a request for mandatory injunction unless the facts and law clearly favor the moving party.,Mandatory injunctions should not issue in doubtful cases.,Actress was not likely to prove her five-second performance in film was a work nor would she likely meet the copyright requirements of authorship and fixation as required to warrant preliminary injunction requiring owner of video-hosting website to remove from website anti-Islamic video into which her performance recorded for different film was incorporated actresss contribution to film was limited to her acting performance which was insufficient to establish her authorship of film film could not be splintered into many copyrightable works and actress herself was not responsible for fixing her performance in a tangible medium. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 102a.,Threats to actresss life and emotional turmoil actress endured as result of unauthorized incorporation of her performance in one film into anti-Islamic video were untethered from and incompatible with copyright and copyrights function as the engine of expression and thus actress could not establish irreparable harm required to support preliminary injunction requiring owner of video-hosting website to remove video from its website due to alleged copyright violation.,Protection of privacy is not a function of copyright law to the contrary copyright law offers a limited monopoly to encourage ultimate public access to the creative work of the author.,Authors cannot seek emotional distress damages under the Copyright Act because such damages are unrelated to the value and marketability of their works. 17 U.S.C.A.  101.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia T.S. Ellis III J. 87 F.Supp.3d 773 granted operators motion to dismiss on basis of invalidity. Patent owner appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Hughes Circuit Judge held that  1 patent was directed to abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in organized manner  2 recitation of concrete tangible components did not bring abstract idea encompassed by patent into realm of patentability.  Affirmed. ,Federal Circuit applies regional circuit law to the review of motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Fourth Circuit reviews challenges to a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Federal Circuit will review de novo a district courts patent eligibility determination. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Laws of nature natural phenomena and abstract ideas are not patentable. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,To determine patent eligibility the court must first determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept such as an abstract idea and if so the court must then consider the elements of each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,When performing a patent eligibility analysis to determine whether the patent claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea requires the court to be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims because at some level all inventions embody use reflect rest upon or apply laws of nature natural phenomena or abstract ideas. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Patent relating to method and system for taking transmitting and organizing digital images was directed to abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in organized manner thus favoring finding of invalidity even though representative claim required concrete tangible components such as telephone unit and server where specification made clear that recited physical components merely provided generic environment in which to classify and store digital images patent claims were directed to use of conventional or generic technology in nascent but well-known environment without any claim that invention reflected any inventive solution to problem presented. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,When performing a patent eligibility analysis it is a relevant inquiry when determining whether the patent claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea to ask whether the claims are directed to an improvement to computer functionality versus being directed to an abstract idea. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Mere recitation of concrete tangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea rather the components must involve more than performance of well-understood routine conventional activities previously known to the industry. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Recitation of concrete tangible components including telephone unit server image analysis unit and control unit in patent relating to method and system for taking transmitting and organizing digital images did not add any inventive concept sufficient to bring into realm of patentability abstract idea encompassed by patent i.e. classifying and storing digital images in organized manner where according to specification telephone unit simply provided environment for carrying out classification and storage functions server was merely generic computer that administered digital images using known arbitrary data bank system image analysis unit predictably analyzed quality of digital images and control unit predictably controlled various aspects of claimed functionality. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,For the role of a computer in a computer-implemented invention to be deemed meaningful in the context of determining patent eligibility it must involve more than performance of well-understood routine and conventional activities previously known to the industry. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Just as steps that do nothing more than spell out what it means to apply it on a computer cannot confer patent eligibility steps that generically spell out what it means to apply it on a telephone network also cannot confer patent eligibility. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,US Patent 6038295.

../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/147 - Arendi SARL v Apple Inc.txt, Background After patentee brought patent infringement action defendants petitioned for inter partes review of patent which was directed to providing beneficial coordination between a first computer program displaying a document and a second computer program for searching an external information source. The United States Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board No. IPR201400208 2015 WL 3638274 issued decision finding that certain claims of patent were invalid as obvious. Patentee appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals OMalley Circuit Judge held that PTAB did not clearly explain its conclusion that with respect to prior art reference it was common sense to search database for telephone number to be added.  Reversed. ,On appeal from inter partes review Court of Appeals reviews the Patent Trial and Appeal Boards PTAB legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence which is something less than the weight of the evidence but more than a mere scintilla of evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.,Patent obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,When determining if a patent is invalid as obvious the court must avoid hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In appropriate circumstances a patent can be obvious in light of a single prior art reference if it would have been obvious to modify that reference to arrive at the patented invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,It is appropriate for the court to consider common sense common wisdom and common knowledge in analyzing patent obviousness. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis an implicit motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior art as a whole but also when the improvement is technology-independent and the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis references to common sense whether to supply a motivation to combine or a missing patent claim limitation cannot be used as a wholesale substitute for reasoned analysis and evidentiary support especially when dealing with a limitation missing from the prior art references specified. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,While common sense can be invoked in the patent obviousness analysis even potentially to supply a limitation missing from the prior art it must still be supported by evidence and a reasoned explanation. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In inter partes review of patent directed to providing beneficial coordination between computer programs one displaying document and other searching external information source Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB did not clearly explain its conclusion that with respect to prior art reference it was common sense to search database for telephone number to be added and thus that patent was invalid as obvious and PTAB instead improperly relied on conclusory statements and unspecific expert testimony regarding searches in general where PTAB ignored patentees arguments regarding differences between searching for duplicate entries with telephone number versus with name or address which was problematic because key limitation of patent was missing from prior art reference. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis the use of common sense does not require a specific hint or suggestion in a particular prior art reference only a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,US Patent 7917843.

may be protected by copyright when they constitute an expression of an idea rather than an idea itself. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,In the copyright context literal copying is verbatim copying of original expression while non-literal copying is paraphrased or loosely paraphrased rather than word for word.,In assessing copyrightability a district court is required to ferret out apparent expressive aspects of a work and then separate protectable expression from unprotectable ideas facts processes and methods of operation. 17 U.S.C.A.  102.,The abstraction-filtration-comparison test for assessing whether the non-literal elements of a computer program constitute expression protectable by copyright eschews bright line approaches and requires a more nuanced assessment of the particular program at issue in order to determine what expression is protectable and infringed. 17 U.S.C.A.  102a.,In the abstraction step of the abstraction-filtration-comparison test for assessing whether the non-literal elements of a computer program constitute expression protectable by copyright the court first breaks down the allegedly infringed program into its constituent structural parts in the filtration step the court sifts out all non-protectable material including ideas and expression that is necessarily incidental to those ideas and in the final step the court compares the remaining creative expression with the allegedly infringing program. 17 U.S.C.A.  102a.,The full analysis of the abstraction-filtration-comparison test for assessing whether the non-literal elements of a computer program constitute expression protectable by copyright only applies where a copyright owner alleges infringement of the non-literal aspects of its work where admitted literal copying of a discrete easily-conceptualized portion of a work is at issue a court need not perform a complete abstraction-filtration-comparison analysis and may focus the protectability analysis on the filtration stage with attendant reference to standard copyright principles. 17 U.S.C.A.  102a.,In the filtration step of the test for assessing whether the non-literal elements of a computer program constitute expression protectable by copyright the court is first to assess whether the expression is original to the programmer or author the court must then determine whether the particular inclusion of any level of abstraction is dictated by considerations of efficiency required by factors already external to the program itself or taken from the public domainall of which would render the expression unprotectable. 17 U.S.C.A.  102a.,While questions regarding originality are considered questions of copyrightability concepts of merger and scenes a faire are affirmative defenses to claims of infringement. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Computer technology developer did not waive its arguments based on search engine operators literal copying of declaring source code in copyright infringement action prior to trial both parties informed court that developers copyright infringement claims included declarations of elements of application programming interfaces API in allegedly infringing source code.,The merger doctrine functions as an exception to the ideaexpression dichotomy in copyright infringement cases it provides that when there are a limited number of ways to express an idea the idea is said to merge with its expression and the expression becomes unprotected.,Under the merger doctrine a court will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the idea contained therein can be expressed in only one way.,Under the merger doctrine when specific parts of a computer programs code even though previously copyrighted are the only and essential means of accomplishing a given task their later use by another will not amount to infringement.,Alternative expressions of idea contained in code of computer technology developers computer program were available and thus idea did not merge with its expression as would preclude copyright protection evidence showed that developer had unlimited options as to selection and arrangement of 7000 lines of code. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq.,Copyrightability and the scope of protectable activity are to be evaluated at the time of creation not at the time of infringement. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Computer technology developers declaring source code contained protectable expression that was entitled to copyright protection portion of declaring code at issue was 7000 lines and developer exercised creativity in selection and arrangement of method declarations when it created packages of application programming interfaces and relevant declaring code. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 103.,The scenes a faire doctrine which is related to the merger doctrine operates to bar certain otherwise creative expression from copyright protection it provides that expressive elements of a work of authorship are not entitled to protection against infringement if they are standard stock or common to a topic or if they necessarily follow from a common theme or setting.,Under the scenes a faire doctrine when certain commonplace expressions are indispensable and naturally associated with the treatment of a given idea those expressions are treated like ideas and therefore are not protected by copyright. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,In the computer context the scenes a faire doctrine denies copyright protection to program elements that are dictated by external factors such as the mechanical specifications of the computer on which a particular program is intended to run or widely accepted programming practices within the computer industry.,Scenes a faire doctrine did not affect copyrightability of either declaring source code in or structure sequence and organization of packages of application programming interfaces at issue in computer technology developers infringement action against search engine operator.,In the copyright context the focus of the scenes a faire doctrine is on the circumstances presented to the creator not the copier.,A set of commands to instruct a computer to carry out desired operations may contain expression that is eligible for copyright protection. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,An original work even one that serves a function is entitled to copyright protection as long as the author had multiple ways to express the underlying idea. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Even if an element directs a computer to perform operations the court must nevertheless determine whether it contains any separable expression entitled to copyright protection. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Computer technology developers packages of application programming interfaces were not precluded from copyright protection just because they also performed functions structure sequence and organization of packages was original and creative and declaring source code could have been written and organized in any number of ways and still have achieved same functions. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,To determine whether certain aspects of an allegedly infringed computer software are not protected by copyright law the focus is on external factors that influenced the choice of the creator of the infringed product.,In determining whether aspects of an allegedly infringed computer software are protected by copyright law the focus is on the compatibility needs and programming choices of the party claiming copyright protection not the choices the defendant made to achieve compatibility with the plaintiffs program.,In determining copyrightability of computer technology developers software district court improperly focused its interoperability analysis on search engine operators desires for its allegedly infringing software whether operators software was interoperable in some sense with any aspect of platform used to create software had no bearing on threshold question of whether developers software was copyrightable. 17 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Copyrighted works do not lose protection when they become the industry standard.,Even when a patented method or system becomes an acknowledged industry standard with acquiescence of the patent owner any permissible use generally requires payment of a reasonable royalty.,The fair use doctrine both permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when on occasion it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The section of the Copyright Act governing the fair use doctrine requires a case-by-case determination whether a particular use is fair. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Fair use of a copyrighted work is a mixed question of law and fact thus while subsidiary and controverted findings of fact must be reviewed for clear error the Court of Appeals reviews the ultimate application of those facts de novo. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Where there are no material facts at issue in a copyright suit and the parties dispute only the ultimate conclusions to be drawn from those facts the court may draw those conclusions without usurping the function of the jury.,Where there are material facts in dispute and those facts have not yet been resolved by the trier of fact appellate courts may not make findings of fact in the first instance and remand is warranted.,The factor of the fair use inquiry examining the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work involves two sub-issues 1 whether and to what extent the new work is transformative and 2 whether the use serves a commercial purpose. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the fair use doctrine the use of a copyrighted work is transformative if it adds something new with a further purpose or different character altering the first with new expression meaning or message the critical question is whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation or instead adds something new. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the fair use doctrine a use is considered transformative only where a defendant changes a plaintiffs copyrighted work or uses the plaintiffs copyrighted work in a different context such that the plaintiffs work is transformed into a new creation. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the fair use doctrine a work is not transformative where the user makes no alteration to the expressive content or message of the original copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Where the use of a copyrighted work is for the same intrinsic purpose as the copyright holders such use seriously weakens a claimed fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Use of a copyrighted work that is commercial tends to weigh against a finding of fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The more transformative a new work the less will be the significance of other factors like commercialism that may weigh against a finding of fair use in a copyright infringement action. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Creative expression falls within the core of a copyrights protective purposes.,Because copyrighted computer programs have both functional and expressive components where the functional components are themselves unprotected those elements should be afforded a lower degree of protection than more traditional literary works.,Where the nature of a copyrighted work is such that purely functional elements exist in the work and it is necessary to copy the expressive elements in order to perform those functions it arguably supports a finding that the use is fair. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the fair use doctrine analysis of the factor asking a court to examine the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole is viewed in the context of the copyrighted work not the infringing work the statutory language makes clear that a taking may not be excused merely because it is insubstantial with respect to the infringing work. 17 U.S.C.A.  1073.,If a secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use then the factor of the fair use doctrine asking a court to examine the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole will not weigh against him or her. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Under the factor of the fair use doctrine asking a court to examine the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole attention turns to the persuasiveness of a parodists justification for the particular copying done and the enquiry will harken back to the first of the statutory factors because the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The fourth and final factor of the fair use doctrine focuses on the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work this factor reflects the idea that fair use is limited to copying by others which does not materially impair the marketability of the work which is copied. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,The factor of the fair use doctrine focusing on the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work requires that courts consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Market harm is a matter of degree and the importance of the factor of the fair use doctrine focusing on the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work will vary not only with the amount of harm but also with the relative strength of the showing on the other factors. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether search engine operators use of computer technology developers copyrighted software was transformative precluding summary judgment on operators fair use defense to copyright infringement claims. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,When reviewing a district courts grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law JMOL the Court of Appeals applies the procedural law of the relevant regional circuit.,The Court of Appeals reviews a district courts judgment as a matter of law JMOL decision de novo applying the same standard as the district court.,To grant judgment as a matter of law JMOL a court must find that the evidence presented at trial permits only one reasonable conclusion and that no reasonable juror could find in the non-moving partys favor.,Even assuming that Ninth Circuit recognized stand-alone de minimis defense to copyright infringement search engine operators copying of computer technology developers software was not de minimus although operator argued that eight decompiled files were insignificant because they were used only to test platform adapted for mobile devices developers expert testified that using the copied files even as test files would have been significant use and district court specifically found that there was no testimony to the contrary.

Cases were transferred by Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and plaintiffs filed consolidated complaint. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California James Ware J. 794 F.Supp.2d 1067 denied providers motion to dismiss and it filed interlocutory appeal.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Bybee Circuit Judge held that  1 definition of readily accessible to the general public with respect to a radio communication did not apply to Wiretap Acts exemption for electronic communication  2 phrase radio communication in Wiretap Act excluded payload data transmitted over wireless local area WiFi networks and  3 providers collection of data from unencrypted WiFi networks did not fall within scope of Wiretap Acts exemption for electronic communications that were readily accessible to general public.

../../files/WestLaw/Alphabet-Google/151 - Interval Licensing LLC v AOL Inc.txt, Background Patentee brought action against alleged infringers claiming infringement of its patents directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Marsha J. Pechman J. 2013 WL 792791 construed patent terms and found the patents invalid. The patentee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Chen Circuit Judge held that  1 the patent phrase unobtrusive manner that does not distract a user was indefinite  2 the term attention manager meant a system that displays images to a user either when the user is not engaged in a primary interaction or in an area of the display screen that is not used by the users primary activity and  3 the term instructions meant a statement that specifies a function to be performed by a system.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,A claim fails to satisfy the statutory requirement to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the applicant regards as the invention and is thus invalid for indefiniteness if its language when read in light of the specification and the prosecution history fails to inform with reasonable certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Court of Appeals reviews the district courts determination that a patent term is indefinite de novo.,Although absolute or mathematical precision is not required to satisfy the definiteness requirement for a term-of-degree phrase in a patent claim it is not enough to identify some standard for measuring the scope of the phrase. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The phrase unobtrusive manner that does not distract a user in patents directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device failed to inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty and thus patent claims that depended on that phrase were invalid for indefiniteness where the phrase had too uncertain a relationship to the patents embodiments to provide definition and an example in the patents specification was not an exclusive definition of the phrase. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,On an allegation of indefiniteness a term of degree fails to provide sufficient notice of its scope if it depends on the unpredictable vagaries of any one persons opinion. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Court of Appeals reviews patent claim construction de novo.,The words of a patent claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning which is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.,Claim language in a patent must be viewed in light of the specification which is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.,In addition to consulting a patents specification a court may also consider the prosecution history and any relevant extrinsic evidence in resolving the meaning of a disputed patent term.,Term attention manager in a patent directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device meant a system that displays images to a user either when the user is not engaged in a primary interaction or in an area of the display screen that is not used by the users primary activity.,Term instructions in a patent directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device meant a statement that specifies a function to be performed by a system.,In the interest of judicial economy the Court of Appeals has the discretion to review a non-dispositive patent claim construction if the Court believes that the construction may become important on remand.,US Patent 6034652.

Melgren J. 2014 WL 2968164 defendant entered conditional guilty plea to distribution of child pornography and possession of child pornography. Defendant appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Gorsuch Circuit Judge held that  1 organization that was statutorily obliged to operate as official national clearinghouse for information about missing and exploited children was a government entity for purpose of determining whether its search of defendants e-mail violated Fourth Amendment and  2 organizations unwarranted search implicated Fourth Amendment.  Reversed and remanded.  Hartz Circuit Judge joined in part. ,When an actor is endowed with law enforcement powers beyond those enjoyed by private citizens courts have traditionally found the exercise of the public police power engaged and such actors actions qualify as an agent of the government for purpose of determining whether a search by the agent was lawful. U.S. Const.Amend. 4.,Organization that was statutorily obliged to operate as official national clearinghouse for information about missing and exploited children was a government entity for purpose of determining whether its search of defendants e-mail violated Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure organization alone was statutorily obliged to maintain an electronic tipline for internet service providers ISP to use to report possible internet child sexual exploitation violations to the government and to forward every single report it received to federal law enforcement agencies ISPs who failed to report known child pornography violations to organization faced substantial penalties payable to federal government when organization confirmed it received a report the ISP was required to treat that confirmation as a request to preserve evidence issued by the government itself and organization was statutorily authorized to receive child pornography knowingly and to review its contents intentionally. U.S. Const.Amend. 4 18 U.S.C.A.  2258A 42 U.S.C.A.  5773b.,Organization that operated as official national clearinghouse for information about missing and exploited children was acting as government entity when it searched defendants e-mail for images of child pornography Congress knew and acquiesced in the possibility that organization would conduct such searches. U.S. Const.Amend. 4 42 U.S.C.A.  5773b.,Opening and reviewing physical mail is generally a search.

The United States District Court for the District of Maryland Deborah K. Chasanow J. 164 F.Supp.2d 688 granted summary judgment for operator and service appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Niemeyer Circuit Judge held that  1 operators conduct did not constitute direct infringement and  2 safe harbor provision in Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA was not exclusive.  Affirmed.  Gregory Circuit Judge dissented and filed opinion. ,Elements of copyright infringement claim are 1 ownership of valid copyright and 2 copying of constituent elements of work that are original. 17 U.S.C.A.  501.,While Copyright Act does not require that direct infringer know that he is infringing or that his conduct amount to willful violation of copyright owners rights it nonetheless requires volitional conduct by person who causes infringement in some meaningful way. 17 U.S.C.A.  501.,Under theory of contributory copyright infringement one who with knowledge of infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to infringing conduct of another is liable for infringement too.,Under theory of vicarious copyright infringement defendant who has right and ability to supervise infringing activity and also has direct financial interest in such activities is similarly liable.,To establish direct liability for copyright infringement something more must be shown than mere ownership of machine used by others to make illegal copies there must be actual infringing conduct with nexus sufficiently close and causal to illegal copying that one could conclude that machine owner himself trespassed on exclusive domain of copyright owner. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501.,Internet service provider ISP could not be held liable as direct copyright infringer when its facility was used by subscriber to violate copyright without intervening conduct of ISP ISP which provided system that automatically received subscribers infringing material and transmitted it to Internet at instigation of subscriber had not itself fixed copy in its system of more than transitory duration. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501.,Safe harbor provision in Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA for internet service providers ISPs is not exclusive and does not preclude ISPs from asserting other affirmative defenses or from arguing that its conduct does not constitute prima facie case of infringement. 17 U.S.C.A.  512l.,When Congress codifies common-law principle common law remains not only good law but valuable touchstone for interpreting statute unless Congress explicitly states that it intends to supplant common law.,Internet service providers ISPs when passively storing material at direction of users in order to make that material available to other users upon their request do not copy material in direct violation of Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C.A.  106.,Automatic copying storage and transmission of copyrighted materials when instigated by others does not render Internet service provider ISP directly liable for copyright infringement ISP can become liable indirectly upon showing of additional involvement sufficient to establish contributory or vicarious infringement but even then may still look to Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA for safe harbor if it fulfilled conditions therein. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501 512.,Operator of web site that hosted online real estate listings for brokers did not lose its status as passive Internet service provider ISP which was immune from liability for direct copyright infringement merely because it screened brokers photographs for propriety before allowing them to be posted cursory screening process did not add volition to operators involvement in storing copy of photograph. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Edward M. Chen 2012 WL 3985118 granted judgment on the pleadings to alleged infringer finding that the patent did not claim patentable subject matter. Patentee appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Hughes Circuit Judge held that the patent involved no more than an abstract idea coupled with routine data-gathering steps and conventional computer activity.  Affirmed.

../../files/WestLaw/Amazon.com/02 - Perfect 10 Inc v Amazoncom Inc.txt, Background Copyright owner brought actions against operator of Internet search engine and Internet retailer for inter alia infringement of copyrighted images. Actions were consolidated. The United States District Court for the Central District of California A. Howard Matz J. 416 F.Supp.2d 828 entered preliminary injunction against some allegedly infringing conduct. Both owner and search engine operator appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Ikuta Circuit Judge held that  1 owner established prima facie case of direct infringement based on operators communication of thumbnail images  2 operators act of framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs was not display of owners works  3 operator did not distribute owners full-size images  4 operators display of thumbnail images of copyright owners photographs was fair use  5 operator substantially assisted third-party websites in distributing their infringing copies of photographs to a worldwide market and assisted worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials for purpose of owners contributory infringement claim  6 owner failed to show likelihood of success on its vicarious infringement claim and  7 owner was unlikely to succeed on merits of its direct infringement and vicarious infringement claims against Internet retailer.  Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded.  Opinion 487 F.3d 701 superseded. ,Where some of allegedly infringed images were registered district court was authorized to enter preliminary injunction covering both registered and unregistered works in owners copyright infringement action against Internet search engine operator and Internet retailer and Court of Appeals thus had jurisdiction over appeal from district courts decision and order. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Although registration is generally a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit for copyright infringement Copyright Act does not limit the remedies a court can grant rather the Copyright Act gives courts broad authority to issue injunctive relief. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Once a court has jurisdiction over an action for copyright infringement under provision of Copyright Act governing initiation of infringement actions the court may grant injunctive relief to restrain infringement of any copyright whether registered or unregistered. 17 U.S.C.A.  411 502a.,Court of Appeals reviews the district courts grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.,District court must support a preliminary injunction with findings of fact which Court of Appeals reviews for clear error.,In reviewing grant or denial of preliminary injunction Court of Appeals reviews the district courts conclusions of law de novo.,Preliminary injunctive relief is available to a party who demonstrates either 1 a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or 2 that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.,In order to demonstrate its likely success on the merits the party moving for a preliminary injunction must necessarily demonstrate it will overcome defenses raised by the non-moving party this burden is correctly placed on the party seeking to demonstrate entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction at an early stage of the litigation before the defendant has had the opportunity to undertake extensive discovery or develop its defenses.,Because defendant in copyright infringement action bears burden of proving fair use once plaintiff moving for preliminary injunction has carried its burden of showing likelihood of success on merits burden shifts to defendant to show likelihood that its affirmative defense will succeed.,Congress enacted Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA provisions governing liability of online service providers to provide greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities. 17 U.S.C.A.  512.,Liability of online service providers for direct contributory or vicarious copyright infringement would be determined without reference to liability limitations set forth by Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA DMCA did not change copyright law but instead provided limitations of liability if provider was found to be liable under existing principles of law and claims against service providers were generally evaluated just as they would be in the non-online world. 17 U.S.C.A.  512.,Plaintiffs must satisfy two requirements to present a prima facie case of direct copyright infringement 1 they must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and 2 they must demonstrate that the alleged infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 501a.,Even if a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of direct copyright infringement by showing ownership of the allegedly infringed material and that the alleged infringers violated at least one of the plaintiffs exclusive rights the defendant may avoid liability if it can establish that its use of the images is a fair use as set forth in the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C.A.  106 107 501a.,A photographic image is a work that is fixed in a tangible medium of expression for purposes of the Copyright Act when embodied that is stored in a computers server or hard disk or other storage device while the image stored in the computer is the copy of the work for purposes of copyright law. 17 U.S.C.A.  101.,Owner of copyrights for photographs established prima facie case of direct infringement of owners statutory right to display copyrighted works based on communication of thumbnail images of owners photographs by operator of Internet search engine which were stored on operators computers to search engine users in response to searches by such users. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 1065.,Internet search engine operators act of framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs on operators website did not constitute display of copies of such photographs within meaning of Copyright Act as would amount to direct infringement where full-size images were not stored on operators own computers but rather operator provided hypertext markup language HTML instructions that directed users browser to an unrelated website publishers computer which stored the full-size image. 17 U.S.C.A.  1065.,Copyright Act unlike the Trademark Act does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion. Trademark Act of 1946  321 15 U.S.C.A.  11141 17 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq.,Internet search engine operators act of framing in users search results in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs that were stored on third parties computers was not transmission or communication of performance or display of work to the public within meaning of Copyright Act operator transmitted or communicated only an address which directed a users browser to location where copy of full-size image was displayed and did not communicate a display of the work itself. 17 U.S.C.A.  101.,Under some circumstances more than one right protected by the Copyright Act must be infringed in order for an infringement claim to arise copyright infringement claimant must be able to claim infringement of its reproduction right in order to claim infringement of its right to prepare derivative works. 17 U.S.C.A.  106.,Cache used by operator of Internet search engine for storing copies of webpages organized and indexed by operator did not infringe the display or distribution rights belonging to owner of copyrighted photographs to extent that cached webpages in-linked to full-sized images of photographs that were stored on third-party website publishers computers regardless of whether cache copies directed users browser to third-party images that were no longer available on a particular publishers website it was publishers computer not operators computer that stored and displayed the infringing image. 17 U.S.C.A.  106.,Operator of Internet search engine did not distribute images of owners copyrighted photographs within meaning of Copyright Act by framing in-line linked full-size images of copyrighted photographs on operators website in response to search and selection by user operator did not itself communicate full-size images to users computer but instead communicated hypertext markup language HTML instructions that told users browser where to find full-size images on a website publishers computer which then distributed copies of the works and because operator did not have collection of stored full-size images that it made available to the public it could not be deemed to distribute copies of the images. 17 U.S.C.A.  101 1063.,The fair use defense permits the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owners consent under certain situations the defense encourages and allows the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones thus providing a necessary counterbalance to the copyright laws goal of protecting creators work product. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Fair use doctrine to copyright infringement permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when on occasion it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Court must be flexible in applying a fair use analysis it is not to be simplified with bright-line rules for the copyright statute like the doctrine it recognizes calls for case-by-case analysis. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Four statutory fair use factors under the Copyright Act may not be treated in isolation one from another all are to be explored and the results weighed together in light of the purposes of copyright. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Purpose of copyright law is to promote the progress of science and useful arts and to serve the welfare of the public. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 1  8 cl. 8.,Central purpose of statutory fair use factor that looks at the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes is to determine whether and to what extent the new work is transformative. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,A work is transformative for purpose of inquiry into fair use factor that looks at the purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work when the new work does not merely supersede the objects of the original creation but rather adds something new with a further purpose or different character altering the first with new expression meaning or message conversely if the new work supersedes the use of the original the use is likely not a fair use. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at purpose and character of the use of a copyrighted work weighed in favor of defendant operator of Internet search engine in copyright infringement action brought by owner of copyrighted photographs based on operators display of thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users even if thumbnail images were derived from infringing third-party websites and showed the image in its entirety because operators use of works was highly transformative search engine provided social benefit by incorporating an original work into a new work namely an electronic reference tool and to extent that operators use was commercial and could supersede owners sale of images such use was not presently significant. 17 U.S.C.A.  1071.,The right of first publication is the authors right to control the first public appearance of his expression because this right encompasses the choices of when where and in what form first to publish a work an author exercises and exhausts this one-time right by publishing the work in any medium.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at nature of the copyrighted work weighed slightly in favor of plaintiff owner of copyrighted photographs in its action alleging copyright infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users images were creative even if they were primarily un-retouched but images were previously published when owner placed its images on the Internet for paid subscribers. 17 U.S.C.A.  1072.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole weighed in favor of neither party in action by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users use of entire image was reasonable in light of purpose of search engine. 17 U.S.C.A.  1073.,Statutory fair use factor that looked at effect of the allegedly infringing use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work favored neither party in action by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging infringement by operator of Internet search engine that displayed thumbnail images of owners works in response to searches by users operators use of images was highly transformative so there was no presumption of market harm and any potential harm to owners market was hypothetical. 17 U.S.C.A.  1074.,Presumption under fair use analysis that likelihood of market harm exists if the intended use of an image is for commercial gain does not arise when a work is transformative because market substitution is at least less certain and market harm may not be so readily inferred. 17 U.S.C.A.  1074.,Internet search engine operators display of thumbnail images of copyright owners photographs in response to user searches was fair use of copyrighted photographs operator put images to a use fundamentally different than use intended by owner thereby providing significant benefit to the public. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,One infringes a copyright contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.,Even if search engine users who linked to websites showing owners copyrighted photographs automatically made cache copies of full size images of the works and such action amounted to direct infringement of owners right of reproduction such automatic copying was fair use of copyrighted images such copying was a transformative use the cache copied no more than was necessary to assist the user in Internet use and the copying had no more than a minimal effect on owners rights while having a considerable public benefit. 17 U.S.C.A.  107.,Within the general rule that one infringes a copyright contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement there are two categories of contributory liability liability may be predicated on actively encouraging or inducing infringement through specific acts or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.,Contribution to copyright infringement must be intentional for liability to arise.,Contributory liability for copyright infringement is analyzed in light of rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law and common law principles establish that intent may be imputed.,An actor may be contributorily liable for intentionally encouraging direct copyright infringement if the actor knowingly takes steps that are substantially certain to result in such direct infringement.,A computer system operator can be held contributorily liable for copyright infringement if it has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system and can take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works yet continues to provide access to infringing works.,Operator of Internet search engine that indexed and organized third-party webpages substantially assisted third-party websites in distributing their infringing copies of copyrighted photographs to a worldwide market and assisted worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials for purpose of copyright owners contributory infringement claim even if operator did not undertake any substantial promotional or advertising efforts to encourage visits to infringing websites nor provide a significant revenue stream to the infringing websites operator could be held contributorily liable if it had knowledge that infringing images were available using its search engine could take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works and failed to take such steps.,To succeed in imposing vicarious liability for copyright infringement a plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from the direct infringement.,A defendant exercises control over a direct copyright infringer for purpose of imposing vicarious liability when he has both a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct as well as the practical ability to do so.,Owner of copyrighted photographs was not likely to succeed on its claim of vicarious copyright infringement by Internet search engine operator that provided to its users links to third-party websites that reproduced displayed and distributed unauthorized copies of owners images as required for preliminary injunction prohibiting such linking owner did not demonstrate likelihood of showing that operator had legal right to stop or limit direct infringement of third-party websites notwithstanding agreements through an advertising program permitting it to terminate an entitys participation in that program operator could not terminate third-party websites or block their ability to host and serve infringing full-size images on the Internet and operator lacked practical ability to police the infringing activities of third-party websites.,Although the lines between direct copyright infringement contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn in general contributory liability is based on the defendants failure to stop its own actions which facilitate third-party infringement while vicarious liability is based on the defendants failure to cause a third party to stop its directly infringing activities.,Internet retailers assertion that it had ended its relationship with operator of Internet search engine whereby retailer was allowed to in-line link to search results generated by search engine did not render moot copyright infringement action brought by owner of copyrighted photographs alleging that retailer provided links to third-party websites that displayed infringing images absent showing by retailer that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.,Owner of copyrighted photographs was unlikely to succeed on merits of its direct infringement and vicarious infringement claims against Internet retailer that provided by agreement with operator of Internet search engine search results to users that included links to third-party websites that contained infringing images as required for preliminary injunction prohibiting such conduct as retailer merely directed users to images stored on computers of operator or third parties and lacked ability to supervise infringing activity of operator or third parties.
../../files/WestLaw/Amazon.com/03 - Multi Time Machine Inc v Amazoncom Inc.txt, Background Military style watch manufacturer brought action alleging that on-line retailers listing of competitors products in response to search for its MTM Special Ops mark on retailers website constituted trademark infringement in violation of Lanham Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California Dean D. Pregerson J. 926 F.Supp.2d 1130 entered summary judgment in retailers favor and manufacturer appealed.  Holding On grant of panel rehearing the Court of Appeals Silverman Circuit Judge held that retailers listing of competitors products did not create substantial likelihood of consumer confusion.  Affirmed.  Bea Circuit Judge dissented and filed opinion.  Opinion 792 F.3d 1070 withdrawn and superseded. ,The core element of trademark infringement is whether the defendants conduct is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.,The eight factors of the test of AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats for evaluating the likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act are 1 strength of the mark 2 proximity of the goods 3 similarity of the marks 4 evidence of actual confusion 5 marketing channels used 6 type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser 7 defendants intent in selecting the mark and 8 likelihood of expansion of the product lines. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,The decision to grant summary judgment in a trademark infringement claim is reviewed de novo and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.,Although disfavored in trademark infringement cases summary judgment may be entered when no genuine issue of material fact exists.,To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act a trademark holder must show that the defendants use of its trademark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,The test for likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act is whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,For a likelihood of confusion to exist under the Lanham Act the confusion must be probable not simply a possibility. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,On-line retailers listing of competitors products in response to search for watch manufacturers MTM Special Ops mark on retailers website did not create substantial likelihood of consumer confusion as to source of competing products and thus did not constitute infringement under Lanham Act although trademarked phrase mtm special ops appeared three times at top of search page manufacturers watches sold for several hundred dollars such that the relevant consumer was reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online and such consumer would not be confused since all of competitors products were clearly labeled with products name and manufacturer in large bright bold letters and photograph of each item was included. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,Some factors of the Sleekcraft test for evaluating the likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act are much more important than others and the relative importance of each individual factor will be case-specific. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,The Sleekcraft test for evaluating the likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act are not exhaustive and other variables may come into play depending on the particular facts presented and this is particularly true in the Internet context. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,Initial interest confusion as a theory of trademark infringement is customer confusion that creates initial interest in a competitors product although dispelled before an actual sale occurs initial interest confusion impermissibly capitalizes on the goodwill associated with a mark and is therefore actionable trademark infringement. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,The nature of the goods and the type of consumer is highly relevant to determining the likelihood of confusion with respect to trademarks in the keyword advertising context and in evaluating this factor a court considers the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,Confusion under the Lanham Act is less likely where buyers exercise care and precision in their purchases such as for expensive or sophisticated items and the default degree of consumer care is becoming more heightened as the novelty of the Internet evaporates and online commerce becomes commonplace. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,The likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act is often a question of fact but not always. Lanham Act  43a1 a1A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a1 a1A.,Where a court can conclude that the consumer confusion alleged by the trademark holder is highly unlikely by simply reviewing the product listingadvertisement at issue summary judgment for the alleged infringer is appropriate.

After parties were ordered to file supplemental briefs addressing buyers standing311 F.Supp.2d 838 the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Marilyn H. Patel J. 2005 WL 3681827 dismissed action. Buyer appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Schroeder Circuit Judge held that buyer suffered no injury in fact and thus lacked standing.  Affirmed. ,Article 3 standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the consideration of any federal claim. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Article 3 standing requires proof of injury-in-fact causation and redressability. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,For Article 3 purposes an antitrust plaintiff establishes injury-in-fact when he has suffered an injury which bears a causal connection to the alleged antitrust violation. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,In response to a summary judgment motion or a trial courts post-pleading stage order to establish Article 3 standing a plaintiff can no longer rest on mere allegations but must set forth by affidavit or other admissible evidence specific facts as to the existence of such standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56e 28 U.S.C.A.,Online buyer of books suffered no injury in fact and thus lacked Article 3 standing to bring Sherman Act challenge to agreement under which bookseller operating exclusively on Internet took over management of conventional booksellers website where academic articles he submitted did not establish that he personally paid higher price for book as result of agreement and he failed to show that he himself experienced any reduced selection of titles or poorer service. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Online buyer of books suffered no injury in fact and thus lacked Article 3 standing to bring Sherman Act challenge to agreement under which bookseller operating exclusively on Internet limited prices it would charge customers of site mirroring conventional booksellers site where buyer failed to show that he paid higher prices after agreement was made than he would have paid otherwise. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Antitrust standing is distinct from Article 3 standing in that Article 3 standing is required to establish a justiciable case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts while antitrust standing is a requirement for treble damages under the Clayton Act. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Lack of antitrust standing affects a plaintiffs ability to recover but does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.

Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,The question of whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate i.e. the question of arbitrability is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.,The threshold question of whether the parties indeed agreed to arbitrate is determined by state contract law principles.,The district court must stay proceedings once it is satisfied that the parties have agreed in writing to arbitrate an issue or issues underlying the district court proceeding.,In deciding motions to compel arbitration courts apply a standard similar to that applicable for a motion for summary judgment which requires a court to consider all relevant admissible evidence submitted by the parties and contained in pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with affidavits and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.,If there is an issue of fact as to the making of the agreement for arbitration then a trial is necessary. 9 U.S.C.A.  4.,Where the undisputed facts in the record require the matter of arbitrability to be decided against one side or the other as a matter of law courts may rule on the basis of that legal issue and avoid the need for further court proceedings.,District court properly chose not to construe online retailers motion to dismiss as a motion to compel arbitration in consumers putative class action against retailer under Consumer Product Safety Act CPSA despite fact that basis for retailers motion to dismiss was that retailers conditions of use agreement required arbitration of disputes where retailers motion to dismiss neither sought an order compelling arbitration nor indicated that it would seek to force consumer to arbitrate in the future. Consumer Product Safety Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2051 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,The Court of Appeals reviews de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim construing the complaint liberally accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,For purposes of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a complaint is deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference.,Where a document is not incorporated by reference the court may nevertheless consider it in deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim where the complaint relies heavily upon its terms and effect thereby rendering the document integral to the complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,A necessary prerequisite for taking into account materials extraneous to the complaint on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is that the plaintiff rely on the terms and effect of the document in drafting the complaint mere notice or possession is not enough. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,Even where a document is considered integral to the complaint it must be clear on the record that no dispute exists regarding the authenticity or accuracy of the document in order for it to be considered on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,It must be clear that there exist no material disputed issues of fact regarding the relevance of a document that is integral to the complaint in order for it to be considered on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,When it is apparent on the face of the complaint and documents properly incorporated therein that claims are subject to arbitration a district court may dismiss in favor of arbitration without the delay of discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,If there is a dispute as to the relevance authenticity or accuracy of the documents relied upon in a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in favor of arbitration the district court may not dismiss the complaint with those materials in mind. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,If the district court is going to rely on the extrinsic materials to determine whether to dismiss in favor of arbitration the proper course is to convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment dismissing the case in favor of arbitration after providing notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6 56.,The determination of whether parties have contractually bound themselves to arbitrate under state law is subject to de novo review by the Court of Appeals.,General contract principles under Washington law apply to agreements made online.,Under Washington law contract formation requires an objective manifestation of mutual assent. Wash. Rev. Code Ann.  62A.2-204.,Under Washington law whether parties manifested mutual assent to form a contract is a question of fact.,Under Washington law the existence of mutual assent to form a contract may be deduced from the circumstances.,Under Washington law where a party has signed a contract without reading it she can argue that mutual assent was lacking if she was deprived of the opportunity to read the contract or if the contract was not plain and unambiguous.,Under Washington law so long as an offeree could have seen a reasonably conspicuous reference to the agreement a jury could conclude that she manifested assent to contract.,Under Washington law the validity of shrinkwrap agreements which have notice on the outside terms on the inside and a right to return the product for a refund if the terms are unacceptable assumes that buyers have notice of the existence of standard adhesion terms even if they are not read or understood.,Manifestation of assent to an online contract is not meaningfully different and can be accomplished by words or silence action or inaction so long as the user intends to engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents.,As with paper contracts or shrinkwrap agreements to be bound an internet user need not actually read the terms and conditions or click on a hyperlink that makes them available as long as she has notice of their existence.,Under Washington law where there is no actual notice of contract terms an offeree is still bound by the provision if he or she is on inquiry notice of the term and assents to it through the conduct that a reasonable person would understand to constitute assent. Wash. Rev. Code Ann.  62A.1-202a3 d.,In determining the validity of browsewrap agreements which involve terms and conditions posted on a website via hyperlink and do not request an express manifestation of assent courts often consider whether a website user has actual or constructive notice of the conditions.,Whether there was notice of the existence of additional contract terms presented on a webpage depends heavily on whether the design and content of that webpage rendered the existence of terms reasonably conspicuous.,Clarity and conspicuousness of arbitration terms are important in securing informed assent to arbitrate.,When terms of an agreement to arbitrate are linked in obscure sections of a webpage that users are unlikely to see courts will refuse to find constructive notice.,Order page and conditions of use on online retailers website were part of the contract incorporated by reference into consumers complaint against retailer and thus consideration of order page and conditions of use in determining retailers motion to dismiss consumers claim in favor of arbitration was proper despite fact that consumer did not attach a copy of order page or conditions of use to his complaint where complaint alleged injuries on the basis of purchases consumer made on retailers website which were made possible only by clicking place your order on the order page which linked to conditions of use. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,District court improperly considered extrinsic materials in dismissing consumers complaint against online retailer in favor of arbitration including retailers assertion that consumers purchases were made using an account created at a specific time and that to have registered for an account at that time one must have checked a box on the registration page acknowledging acceptance of the current conditions of use where facts regarding consumers creation of an account were neither alleged nor integral to the complaint and consumer disputed the authenticity and relevancy of the extrinsic materials. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,Under Washington contract law unilateral modifications to terms of a contract are only binding if there is notice and assent to the changed terms.,Issue of whether consumer was on notice of and agreed to conditions of use which contained requirement to arbitrate all disputes linked to online retailers order page could not be resolved at motion to dismiss phase of consumers action against retailer for violation of Consumer Product Safety Act because of factual dispute as to whether order page contained notice of the conditions of use sufficient to contractually bind consumer to the terms contained in the conditions of use. Consumer Product Safety Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2051 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12b6.,While clickwrap agreements that display terms in a scrollbox and require users to click an icon are not necessarily required to form a binding contract with regard to an online purchase they are certainly the easiest method of ensuring that terms are agreed to.,Generally courts should consider the merits of a requested preliminary injunction even where the validity of the underlying claims will be determined in arbitration.,The Court of Appeals generally reviews the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.,A district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact.,The existence of standing is a question of law that the Court of Appeals reviews de novo.,To satisfy Article IIIs jurisdictional requirement limiting judicial power to the resolution of Cases and Controversies 1 the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact 2 there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct at issue and 3 the injury must be likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. U.S. Const. art. 3.,For each form of relief sought a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately.,A plaintiff seeking to represent a class must personally have standing.,Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive relief where they are unable to establish a real or immediate threat of injury.,Although past injuries may provide a basis for standing to seek money damages they do not confer standing to seek injunctive relief unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that she is likely to be harmed again in the future in a similar way.,While enhanced risk of future injury may constitute injury-in-fact required for standing to pursue injunctive relief in certain circumstances such injuries are only cognizable where the plaintiff alleges actual future exposure to that increased risk.,Consumer who purchased weight loss product from online retailer that alleged contained a controlled substance that had been removed from the market failed to establish a likelihood of future or continuing harm and thus was not entitled to preliminary injunction in his action against retailer for violation of Consumer Product Safety Act CPSA requiring remedial notices be sent to past purchasers of products containing controlled substance and requiring measures be put into place to prevent future sales of such products where consumer did not show that he was likely to be subjected to future sales by retailer of products containing controlled substance retailer had ceased selling weight loss product at issue on its website and consumer failed to allege he intended to use retailer in future to buy any products.

../../files/WestLaw/Amazon.com/73 - United States v American Express Company.txt, Background United States brought action against credit and charge card issuer alleging issuer engaged in restraint of trade by including nondiscriminatory provisions in its contracts with merchants that prevented merchants from steering customers to alternative card brands. Following a bench trial the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York Garaufis J. 88 F.Supp.3d 143 entered judgment against issuer and imposed a permanent injunction 2015 WL 1966362. Issuer appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Wesley Circuit Judge held that  1 relevant market was not limited to market for general purpose credit and charge card network services but extended to market for cardholders and  2 government failed to demonstrate that issuer possessed sufficient market power to affect competition adversely in the relevant market.  Reversed and remanded. ,On appeal from a bench trial the Court of Appeals reviews a district courts findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.,The application of law to undisputed facts is subject to de novo review by the Court of Appeals on appeal.,A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.,To prove a restraint of trade violation of the Sherman Act a plaintiff must demonstrate 1 a combination or some form of concerted action between at least two legally distinct economic entities that 2 unreasonably restrains trade. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,The Sherman Act aims to protect competition as a whole in the relevant market not the individual competitors within that market. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,Disputes between business competitors are not the proper subjects of antitrust actions under the Sherman Act. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,To determine whether a practice unreasonably restrains trade in violation of the Sherman Act courts apply one of two rules designed to provide guidance in forming judgments about the competitive significance of challenged restraints under the per se rule certain practices for example horizontal price-fixing or market division with no purpose other than to limit competition are entitled to a conclusive presumption of unreasonableness and thus considered per se illegal and all other practices are analyzed under the rule of reason. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Agreements that constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade under the Sherman Act may be either horizontal that is agreements between competitors at the same level of the market structure or vertical that is combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure for example manufacturers and distributors. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Vertical restraints of trade are generally judged under the Sherman Acts rule of reason. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,A plaintiff bringing an unreasonable restraint of trade claim under the Sherman Act bears the initial burden of demonstrating that a defendants challenged behavior had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,If the plaintiff bringing an unreasonable restraint of trade claim under the Sherman Act cannot establish anticompetitive effects directly by showing an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole within the relevant market he or she nevertheless may establish anticompetitive effects indirectly by showing that the defendant has sufficient market power to cause an adverse effect on competition. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Because market power is but a surrogate for detrimental effects a plaintiff seeking to use market power as a proxy for adverse effect on a Sherman Act restraint of trade claim must show market power plus some other ground for believing that the challenged behavior could harm competition in the market such as the inherent anticompetitive nature of the defendants behavior or the structure of the interbrand market. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Once the plaintiff satisfies its initial burden to prove anticompetitive effects the burden on a Sherman Act unreasonable restraint of trade claim shifts to the defendant to offer evidence of any procompetitive effects of the restraint at issue if the defendant can provide such proof then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that any legitimate competitive benefits offered by defendant could have been achieved through less restrictive means. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,When output expands at the same time that prices increase a fact-finder may not infer competitive injury on a Sherman Act unreasonable restraint of trade claim from price and output data absent some evidence that tends to prove that output was restricted or prices were above a competitive level. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,To prevail on an unreasonable restraint of trade claim under the Sherman Act a plaintiff must show more than just an adverse effect on competition among different sellers of the same product the overarching standard is whether defendants actions diminish overall competition and hence consumer welfare. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Relevant market in governments antitrust action against credit and charge card issuer which alleged that issuers agreements with merchants contained nondiscriminatory provisions that constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade under the Sherman Act was not limited to the market for general purpose credit and charge card network services but extended to the market for cardholders where the two markets were interdependent as the price charged by issuer to merchants necessarily affected cardholder demand which in turn had an effect on merchant demand and the amount charged to merchants in fees funded the rewards paid to cardholders. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Market definition in an antitrust action under the Sherman Act is a deeply fact-intensive inquiry because its purpose is to identify the market participants and competitive pressures that restrain an individual firms ability to raise prices or restrict output. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,Proper market definition in an antitrust action under Sherman Act can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,To define the relevant market for a Sherman Act antitrust claim a court often applies a hypothetical monopolist test HMT asking whether a hypothetical monopolist acting within the proposed market would be substantially constrained from increasing prices by the ability of customers to switch to other producers.

Reversed. ,On appeal from inter partes review Court of Appeals reviews the Patent Trial and Appeal Boards PTAB legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence which is something less than the weight of the evidence but more than a mere scintilla of evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.,Patent obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,When determining if a patent is invalid as obvious the court must avoid hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In appropriate circumstances a patent can be obvious in light of a single prior art reference if it would have been obvious to modify that reference to arrive at the patented invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,It is appropriate for the court to consider common sense common wisdom and common knowledge in analyzing patent obviousness. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis an implicit motivation to combine exists not only when a suggestion may be gleaned from the prior art as a whole but also when the improvement is technology-independent and the combination of references results in a product or process that is more desirable. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis references to common sense whether to supply a motivation to combine or a missing patent claim limitation cannot be used as a wholesale substitute for reasoned analysis and evidentiary support especially when dealing with a limitation missing from the prior art references specified. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,While common sense can be invoked in the patent obviousness analysis even potentially to supply a limitation missing from the prior art it must still be supported by evidence and a reasoned explanation. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In inter partes review of patent directed to providing beneficial coordination between computer programs one displaying document and other searching external information source Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB did not clearly explain its conclusion that with respect to prior art reference it was common sense to search database for telephone number to be added and thus that patent was invalid as obvious and PTAB instead improperly relied on conclusory statements and unspecific expert testimony regarding searches in general where PTAB ignored patentees arguments regarding differences between searching for duplicate entries with telephone number versus with name or address which was problematic because key limitation of patent was missing from prior art reference. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,In the patent obviousness analysis the use of common sense does not require a specific hint or suggestion in a particular prior art reference only a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,US Patent 7917843.

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./040 - GPNE Corp v Apple Inc.txt", Background Patentee brought action alleging infringement of two patents related to two-way paging system in which devices were capable of not only receiving messages but also sending messages back in response. Following jury verdict of noninfringement the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Lucy H. Koh J. 108 F.Supp.3d 839 denied patentees motion for judgment as matter of law as to infringement or in alternative for new trial and defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law on its indefiniteness defense. Patentee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Chief Judge held that  1 term node was appropriately classified as pager  2 phrase operates independently of a telephone network limited scope of invention  3 courts construction was sufficient to resolve parties dispute over scope of term node and  4 new trial was unwarranted.  Affirmed. ,Term node as used in patents related to two-way paging system in which devices were capable of not only receiving messages but also sending messages back in response was appropriately classified as pager where words pager and pager units appeared in specification over 200 times and apart from abstract specification repeatedly and exclusively used these words to refer to devices in patented system and while specification disclosed information about features of devices and network they operated on none of this was inconsistent with characterizing devices as type of pager.,Words of a patent claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning which is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention.,When construing a patent claim a person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears but in the context of the entire patent including the specification and thus the only meaning that matters in claim construction is the meaning in the context of the patent.,When a patent repeatedly and consistently characterizes a claim term in a particular way it is proper to construe the claim term in accordance with that characterization.,Patent claim differentiation is not a hard and fast rule but rather a presumption that will be overcome when the specification or prosecution history dictates a contrary construction.,Phrase operates independently of a telephone network as used in summation sentence for patents related to two-way paging system in which devices were capable of not only receiving messages but also sending messages back in response limited scope of invention even though summation was only place that phrase appeared where summation described the invention as a whole and patents prosecution history included inventors declaration which stated several times that invention operated independently of telephone network.,When a patent describes the features of the present invention as a whole this description limits the scope of the invention.,Patentee did not waive its argument that district court committed reversible error in infringement suit by failing to construe term pager as used in patents related to two-way paging system in which devices were capable of not only receiving messages but also sending messages back in response thus leaving claim construction matter for jury where parties disputed construction of term node including whether pager would be appropriate word to help define scope of node and district court was aware of this dispute.,Generally litigants waive their right to present new patent claim construction disputes if they are raised for the first time after trial.,District courts construction was sufficient to resolve parties dispute over scope of term node as used in patents related to two-way paging system where construction specified that node was not simply any pager but one that must be capable of two-way communications transmitting wireless data communications on paging system and functioning on paging system that operated independently from telephone network thus clarifying that type of pager that node must be was not older-style legacy pager as was asserted in post-trial challenge to courts construction.,When the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a patent claim term it is the courts duty to resolve it since the ultimate question of claim construction is a legal question for the judge and not the jury.,Where a district court has resolved the questions about patent claim scope that were raised by the parties it is under no obligation to address other potential ambiguities that have no bearing on the operative scope of the claim since such an endeavor could proceed ad infinitum as every word whether a claim term itself or the words a court uses to construe a claim term is susceptible to further definition elucidation and explanation.,In patent infringement suit related to two-way paging system new trial was unwarranted even if trial court erred in allowing defendant to devote substantial amount of time to comparing accused devices to older-style legacy pagers purportedly in order to offer jury appealingly simplified ways to determine infringement where patentee had ample opportunities to rebut defendants argument and in fact did so on several occasions.,Under Ninth Circuit law a federal judge has broad discretion in supervising a trial including the supervision of attorney arguments and his or her behavior during trial justifies reversal only if it abuses that discretion.,Ninth Circuit will not reverse a judgment because of statements made in the arguments of counsel unless they were so prejudicial that a failure to declare a mistrial was an abuse of discretion.,In patent infringement suit related to two-way paging system district court appropriately declined to give clarifying instruction on term pager which was used as classification for node as used in patents at issue where patentee argued that courts construction did not prohibit node from referring to both pager and telephone but plain words of courts construction directed that operating independently from a telephone network was capability.,US Patent 7570954 US Patent 7792492.

Holdings The Court of Appeals Hughes Circuit Judge held that  1 patent was directed to abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in organized manner  2 recitation of concrete tangible components did not bring abstract idea encompassed by patent into realm of patentability.  Affirmed. ,Federal Circuit applies regional circuit law to the review of motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Fourth Circuit reviews challenges to a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Federal Circuit will review de novo a district courts patent eligibility determination. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Laws of nature natural phenomena and abstract ideas are not patentable. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,To determine patent eligibility the court must first determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept such as an abstract idea and if so the court must then consider the elements of each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,When performing a patent eligibility analysis to determine whether the patent claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea requires the court to be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims because at some level all inventions embody use reflect rest upon or apply laws of nature natural phenomena or abstract ideas. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Patent relating to method and system for taking transmitting and organizing digital images was directed to abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in organized manner thus favoring finding of invalidity even though representative claim required concrete tangible components such as telephone unit and server where specification made clear that recited physical components merely provided generic environment in which to classify and store digital images patent claims were directed to use of conventional or generic technology in nascent but well-known environment without any claim that invention reflected any inventive solution to problem presented. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,When performing a patent eligibility analysis it is a relevant inquiry when determining whether the patent claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea to ask whether the claims are directed to an improvement to computer functionality versus being directed to an abstract idea. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Mere recitation of concrete tangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea rather the components must involve more than performance of well-understood routine conventional activities previously known to the industry. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Recitation of concrete tangible components including telephone unit server image analysis unit and control unit in patent relating to method and system for taking transmitting and organizing digital images did not add any inventive concept sufficient to bring into realm of patentability abstract idea encompassed by patent i.e. classifying and storing digital images in organized manner where according to specification telephone unit simply provided environment for carrying out classification and storage functions server was merely generic computer that administered digital images using known arbitrary data bank system image analysis unit predictably analyzed quality of digital images and control unit predictably controlled various aspects of claimed functionality. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,For the role of a computer in a computer-implemented invention to be deemed meaningful in the context of determining patent eligibility it must involve more than performance of well-understood routine and conventional activities previously known to the industry. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Just as steps that do nothing more than spell out what it means to apply it on a computer cannot confer patent eligibility steps that generically spell out what it means to apply it on a telephone network also cannot confer patent eligibility. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,US Patent 6038295.

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./053 - Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.txt", Background Owner of patents related to smartphone technology brought infringement action against competitor. Competitor counterclaimed for infringement of competitors patents. Following jury trial the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Lucy H. Koh J. 67 F.Supp.3d 1100 denied motions for judgment as a matter of law entered judgment finding that patents were not invalid and awarding patent owner 119.6 million in damages for infringement of asserted claims of three patents and 2014 WL 4467837 denied competitors motion for judgment as a matter of law of noninfringement. Cross-appeals were taken.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Dyk Circuit Judge held that  1 accused devices did not infringe patent covering software to detect structures such as a phone number  2 claim in patent directed to smartphones slide to unlock feature was obvious  3 evidence of secondary considerations was insufficient to overcome obviousness determination  4 claim providing method of automatically correcting typographical errors as the user is typing on smartphone was obvious  5 accused device did not infringe patent covering universal search on a smartphone  6 accused device did not infringe patent covering background sync and describing systems methods and computer readable media for synchronizing data between multiple devices and  7 accused device infringed patent directed to camera systems for compressingdecompressing and organizing digital files.  Affirmed in part and reversed in part. ,The Federal Circuit reviews a district courts order granting or denying judgment as a matter of law under the standard applied by the regional circuit.,In the Ninth Circuit the review of the district courts order granting or denying judgment as a matter of law is de novo and the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.,There was no evidence that accused software library programs in competitors cellular phones ran separately from web browser and text messaging applications and thus accused devices did not have an analyzer server for detecting structures in the data and for linking actions to the detected structures as required to infringe patent covering software to detect structures such as a phone number in text and to turn those structures into links thus allowing a user to click on the structure to take an action rather than having to copy and paste the structure into another application.,Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Secondary considerations such as commercial success long felt but unsolved needs and the failure of others must be considered when determining obviousness for such evidence to be probative of nonobviousness a patentee must demonstrate a nexus between the patented features and the particular evidence of secondary considerations. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Claim in patent directed to smartphones slide to unlock feature where a user can slide a moving image across the screen of the phone with his finger to unlock the phone would have been obvious over combination of prior art prior art reference disclosed using a touch gesture on the screen to unlock a phone but did not have a moving image associated with the gesture and second reference disclosed touchscreen-based toggle switches and skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine references when faced with inadvertent activation problem because both disclosed essentially the same structure a touchscreen device with software that allowed user to slide his finger across screen to change interface states. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Whether a reference in the prior art is analogous is a fact question.,A reference qualifies as analogous prior art if it is from the same field of endeavor regardless of the problem addressed or if the reference is not within the field of the inventors endeavor the reference still is reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor is involved.,When determining whether a reference is analogous art the field of endeavor is determined by reference to explanations of the inventions subject matter in the patent application including the embodiments function and structure of the claimed invention.,Weak secondary considerations generally do not overcome a strong prima facie case of obviousness this is particularly true when an invention involves nothing more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Patent owners evidence of secondary considerations was insufficient to overcome conclusion that claim directed to smartphones slide to unlock feature where a user can slide a moving image across the screen of the phone with his finger to unlock the phone would have been obvious contention that patent owners method for solving issue of accidental activation was better and more intuitive than previous methods was not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a long-felt but unmet need approval by fans who may or may not have been skilled in the art during presentation of new smartphone was not indication of industry praise and evidence that customers preferred to purchase device with a slide-to-unlock capacity did not show nexus with commercial success absent information regarding alternative device consumers were comparing device to. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,When determining secondary considerations of nonobviousness to demonstrate long felt need the patentee must point to an articulated identified problem and evidence of efforts to solve that problem which were before the invention unsuccessful but where the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention are minimal it cannot be said that any long-felt need was unsolved. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Expression of disbelief by experts and then later acquiescence to the invention may be strong evidence of nonobviousness similarly industry recognition of the achievement of the invention such as awards may suggest nonobviousness provided that the praise is tied to the invention claimed by the patent. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Evidence of copying of a feature in a patent owners commercial product is not sufficient to demonstrate nonobviousness of the claimed invention where there is a substantial question of validity raised by the prior art references cited by the accused infringer. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Patent claim providing method of automatically correcting typographical errors as the user is typing on smartphone was obvious autocorrection features were known in the prior art and skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine reference directed to a keyboard system with automatic correction which described touchscreen keyboard that can automatically correct incorrectly typed text and reference disclosing letter and word choice text input method and describing quick selection of choices to be implemented seamlessly for reduced keyboard systems like those in mobile devices and there was no evidence of copying or evidence demonstrating nexus between commercial success of smartphone and features claimed by patent. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,To be relevant when evaluating secondary considerations of nonobviousness commercial success must be linked to the merits of the claimed invention rather than features known in the prior art.,A nexus must be established between the merits of the claimed invention and the evidence of commercial success before that issue becomes relevant to the issue of obviousness. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Search function on competitors phones did not locate information on Internet and thus did not infringe patent covering universal search on a smartphone search function only searched information previously pulled from the Internet and did not search the Internet as required by patent claim language.,Competitors smartphone did not contain synchronization software components configured to synchronize for e-mail as would infringe patent covering background sync and describing systems methods and computer readable media for synchronizing data between multiple devices accused devices e-mail software was not configured to synchronize because it did not synchronize data by itself but rather indirectly caused synchronization by calling other software components.,Term means for transmission in patent pertaining to remote video transmission and providing a method and means for

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./074 - US v Apple Inc.txt", Background United States and 33 states and U.S. territories brought antitrust suits against company that manufactured tablet computer and distributed electronic books e-books as well as several book publishers alleging conspiracy to raise fix and stabilize retail prices for newly-released and best-selling trade e-books in violation of Sherman Act and various state laws. After a bench trial on issue of liability the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Denise Cote J. 952 F.Supp.2d 638 entered an injunction upon finding company orchestrated a conspiracy to raise e-book prices and 992 F.Supp.2d 263 denied companys motion for stay of monitorship. Company and publishers appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Debra Ann Livingston Circuit Judge held that  1 company entered into agreement with publishers to raise consumer-facing e-book prices  2 company entering into individual contracts did not preclude finding that contracts resulted in a per se restraint of trade  3 company was not part of joint venture or other productive relationship with publishers  4 agreement was a per se unlawful price-fixing conspiracy  5 injunction was appropriately designed and  6 judicial estoppel was not warranted.  Affirmed.  Lohier Circuit Judge filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Dennis Jacobs Circuit Judge filed a dissenting opinion. ,Under the Sherman Act horizontal agreements to set prices are with limited exceptions per se unlawful while the vertical agreements on pricing are unlawful only if an assessment of market effects known as a rule-of-reason analysis reveals that they unreasonably restrain trade. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,The Sherman Act bans restraints on trade effected by a contract combination or conspiracy. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,The first crucial question in a Sherman Act case alleging a trust in restraint of trade is whether the challenged conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement tacit or express. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,In a Sherman Act action alleging a trust in restraint of trade identifying the existence and nature of a conspiracy requires determining whether the evidence reasonably tends to prove that the defendant and others had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Parallel action is not by itself sufficient to prove the existence of a conspiracy in violation of Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade such behavior could be the result of coincidence independent responses to common stimuli or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Parallel behavior that does not result from an agreement is not unlawful in violation of Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade even if it is anticompetitive. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,To prove an antitrust conspiracy a plaintiff must show the existence of additional circumstances often referred to as plus factors which when viewed in conjunction with the parallel acts can serve to allow a fact-finder to infer a conspiracy to violate Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade these additional circumstances can of course consist of direct evidence that the defendants entered into an agreement like a recorded phone call in which two competitors agreed to fix prices but plaintiffs may also present circumstantial facts supporting the inference that a conspiracy existed. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Circumstances that may raise an inference of conspiracy to violate Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade include a common motive to conspire evidence that shows that the parallel acts were against the apparent individual economic self-interest of the alleged conspirators and evidence of a high level of interfirm communications parallel conduct alone may support an inference of conspiracy moreover if it consists of complex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors and made for no other discernible reason. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Finding of conspiracy to violate Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade requires evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that a defendant was acting independently this requirement however does not mean that a plaintiff must disprove all nonconspiratorial explanations for the defendants conduct but the evidence need only be sufficient to allow a reasonable fact finder to infer that the conspiratorial explanation is more likely than not. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books entered into agreement with book publishers to raise consumer-facing e-book prices as required to find company violated Sherman Act provision prohibiting trusts in restraint of trade individual contracts with publishers were attractive to publishers only if they collectively shifted their relationships with a competitor e-book distributor to model company knew would result in higher e-book prices company executive when announcing launch of tablet computer predicted that e-book prices would be same between company and competitor publishers were in constant communication with each other regarding negotiations with company and competitor company kept publishers updated on how many of them had signed contracts with company and reminded them that company was offering publishers the best chance to challenge competitors price point and publishers kept company updated on negotiations with competitor. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Antitrust law does not require identical motives among conspirators when their independent reasons for joining together lead to collusive action. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,In antitrust cases the character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts but only by looking at it as a whole. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,To succeed on a Sherman Act antitrust claim a plaintiff must prove that the common scheme designed by the conspirators constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade either per se or under the rule of reason. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,In Sherman At antitrust cases per se and rule-of-reason analysis are two methods of determining whether a restraint is unreasonable that is whether its anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive effects. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Because the balancing of whether a restraint of trade is reasonable typically requires case-by-case analysis most antitrust claims are analyzed under the rule of reason according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Some restraints of trade have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit that they are deemed unlawful per se this rule reflects a longstanding judgment that case-by-case analysis is unnecessary for certain practices that by their nature have a substantial potential to unreasonably restrain competition. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,That company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books entered into individual vertical contracts with book publishers did not preclude finding that contracts resulted in a per se restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act at issue was alleged price-fixing conspiracy that resulted from individual contracts. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books was not part of joint venture or other productive relationship with book publishers that required publishers to coordinate with one another on price as required to preclude finding that alleged price-fixing conspiracy between company and publishers was a per se unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act creating e-book retail market did not require participants to coordinate with one another. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Agreement between company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books and book publishers to raise e-book prices was a per se unlawful price-fixing conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act purpose of agreements was to eliminate competitor e-book distributors pricing for new releases and bestsellers which publishers believed threatened their short-term ability to sell hardcover books at higher prices agreement had intended effect as competitors prices increased immediately and e-book sales decreased. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,After finding company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books violated the Sherman Act by entering into agreements with book publishers to raise e-book prices provision of injunction prohibiting company from entering into agreements with publishers that restricted companys ability to set e-book prices was appropriately designed to guard against future anticompetitive conduct and therefore did not require vacatur despite publishers contention that provision modified consent decrees into which they had previously entered decrees prohibited publishers from restricting any retailers authority to set prices and injunction did not alter that term but applied only to company. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Judicial estoppel is invoked by a court at its discretion and is designed to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.,While the propriety of applying judicial estoppel depends heavily on the specific factual context before a court courts typically consider whether the partys argument is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position whether the party succeeded in persuading a court to accept that earlier position and whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.,Relief is granted pursuant to judicial estoppel only when the impact on judicial integrity is certain.,After finding company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books violated the Sherman Act by entering into agreements with book publishers to raise e-book prices arguments by the United States in seeking injunction provision prohibiting company from entering into agreements with publishers that restricted companys ability to set e-book prices were neither so clearly inconsistent with earlier arguments in entering consent decrees with publishers that prohibited publishers from restricting any retailers authority to set prices nor so unfairly detrimental to publishers as to warrant judicial estoppel U.S. sought two-year ban in consent decree and a five-year ban as to company specifically and U.S. had presented extensive evidence about relationship between publishers and company. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,A government plaintiff unlike a private plaintiff must seek to obtain relief necessary to protect the public from further anticompetitive conduct and to redress anticompetitive harm.,The district courts have large discretion to model judgments in antitrust cases initiated by the government to fit the exigencies of the particular case and all doubts about the remedy are to be resolved in the governments favor.,After finding company that manufactured tablet computers and distributed electronic books e-books violated the Sherman Act by entering into agreements with book publishers to raise e-book prices district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering injunction to prohibit company from entering into agreements with publishers that restricted companys ability to set e-book prices and in ordering company to treat e-book applications for its electronic devices the same way it treated other applications injunction ensured that company and publishers would not be able to engage in another conspiracy to set prices. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.

After trial jury entered verdict in favor of manufacturer. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Lucy H. Koh J. 920 F.Supp.2d 1079 granted in part and denied in part competitors motion for judgment as a matter of law to overturn certain jury findings and 926 F.Supp.2d 1100 denied manufacturers motion to increase damages award and ordered new trial as to damages for certain products. Competitor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Chief Judge held that  1 unregistered trade dress for physical design of certain of manufacturers products was functional  2 registered trade dress for design of on-screen icons was functional  3 court appropriately instructed jury  4 excluding testimony to rebut allegation of copying was appropriate  5 claim related to double tapping feature was not invalid for indefiniteness  6 award of lost profits was appropriate and  7 testimony of manufacturers expert provided sufficient evidence to supports reasonable royalty awards.  Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. ,In the Ninth Circuit courts review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.,On a motion for judgment as a matter of law the test is whether the evidence construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party permits only one reasonable conclusion and that conclusion is contrary to that of the jury.,In the Ninth Circuit courts review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.,In evaluating jury instructions prejudicial error results when looking to the instructions as a whole the substance of the applicable law is not fairly and correctly covered.,In the Ninth Circuit courts may order a new trial based on a jury instruction error only if the error was prejudicial.,In the Ninth Circuit a motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of evidence may be granted only if the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence or it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result.,When reviewing Lanham Act claims the Federal Circuit looks to the law of the regional circuit where the district court sits. Lanham TradeMark Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1051 et seq.,Protection for trade dress exists to promote competition.,Trademark law allows for a perpetual monopoly and its use in the protection of physical details and designs of a product must be limited to those that are nonfunctional.,Generally a product feature is functional and thus not protected under trademark law if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.,Product feature need only have some utilitarian advantage to be considered functional and thus not protected under trademark law.,Trade dress taken as a whole is functional and thus not protected under trademark law if it is in its particular shape because it works better in this shape.,To analyze the functionality of a trade dress the Ninth Circuit applies four factors 1 whether the design yields a utilitarian advantage 2 whether alternative designs are available 3 whether advertising touts the utilitarian advantages of the design and 4 whether the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Electronics manufacturers unregistered trade dress for physical design of certain smartphone products had utilitarian advantage favoring finding under Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality that trade dress was functional and thus not protected under trademark law where manufacturers executive testified that design theme of these products was to create new breakthrough design that was not only beautiful but also simple and easy to use and manufacturer conceded that trade dress improved quality of these products in some respects. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,In Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality of a trade dress the factor as to whether alternative designs are available requires that purported alternative designs offer exactly the same features as the asserted trade dress in order to show non-functionality. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Manufacturer does not have rights under trade dress law to compel its competitors to resort to alternative designs which have a different set of advantages and disadvantages.,Electronics manufacturer cataloged mere existence of other design possibilities embodied in rejected prototypes of certain of its smartphone products but it failed to show that any of these alternatives offered exact same features as asserted unregistered trade dress regarding physical design as required to establish non-functionality under availability of alternative designs factor in Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,If a seller advertises the utilitarian advantages of a particular feature this constitutes strong evidence of functionality under the Ninth Circuits four-factor test for the functionality of a trade dress. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Electronics manufacturers advertising touted utilitarian advantage of its unregistered trade dress for physical design of certain smartphone products favoring finding under Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality that trade dress was functional and thus not protected under trademark law where substance of advertisements allowed viewers to learn how user interface of products touch screen worked. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Electronics manufacturer pointed to no evidence showing that certain of its smartphone products using subject trade dress regarding physical design were not relatively simple or inexpensive to manufacture favoring finding under Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality that subject unregistered trade dress was functional and thus not protected under trademark law where any manufacturing challenges manufacturer experienced resulted from durability considerations and not from design of unregistered trade dress and durability advantages that resulted from these challenges were outside scope of manufacturers definition of its unregistered trade dress. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Electronics manufacturers unregistered trade dress for physical design of certain smartphone products was functional under Ninth Circuits four-factor test for functionality and thus not protected under trademark law even though manufacturer focused on beauty of its design where manufacturer pursued both beauty and functionality in that elements in unregistered trade dress also served purpose of improving usability. Lanham Act  43c4A 15 U.S.C.A.  1125c4A.,Federal trademark registration provides prima facie evidence of non-functionality and thus protectability under trademark law and this presumption shifts the burden of production to the defendant to provide evidence of functionality.,One the presumption of non-functionality for a federally registered trademark is overcome the registration loses its legal significance on the issue of functionality.,Electronics manufacturers federally registered trade dress claiming design details in each of sixteen icons on home screen of its smartphone products was functional and thus not protected under trademark law where icon designs individually or viewed as a whole promoted usability by communicating to users that selecting individual icons would trigger corresponding functionality.,Where a design contains both functional and nonfunctional elements the scope of the claim must be construed in order to identify the non-functional aspects of the design shown in the patent.,It is the non-functional design aspects that are pertinent to determinations of design patent infringement.,In electronics manufacturers suit against competitor alleging infringement of design patents related to certain smartphone products jury instruction to compare accused devices to patented designs according to the overall appearances did not prejudice competitor where instructions as a whole appropriately limited scope of design patents to ornamental elements through claim constructions in that patents were each construed as claiming the ornamental design shown in patent figures.,Jury instructions are reviewed as a whole to determine whether the substance of the applicable law is not fairly and correctly covered such that the alleged error is prejudicial.,Design patent is infringed if an ordinary observer would have been deceived even in absence of actual deception.,Patent infringement analysis must include a comparison of the asserted design against the prior art if the accused design has copied a particular feature of the claimed design that departs conspicuously from the prior art the accused design is naturally more likely to be regarded as deceptively similar to the claimed design and thus infringing.,In electronics manufacturers suit against competitor alleging infringement of design patents related to certain smartphone products excluding testimony regarding competitors independent development of specific smartphone product predating manufacturers products which competitor asserted to rebut allegation of copying where witness did not design any accused device and was unaware that any accused device was based on particular product such that testimony had limited probative value that was outweighed by likelihood that jury would consider testimony for prohibited purpose under earlier discovery sanction against competitor for failure to timely disclose this testimony. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,Clear language of statute providing for damages in design patent infringement cases precludes any requirement that the successful patentee show what portion of the infringers profit or its own lost profit is due to the asserted design. 35 U.S.C.A.  289.,Patent claim related to smartphone user interface feature in which users double tapping on portion of electronic document caused portion to be enlarged and substantially centered on display was not invalid for indefiniteness any complaint about lack of objective standard of measure sought level of precision beyond what was necessary under definiteness requirement and skilled artisans could reasonably interpret phrase substantially centered to mean essentially centered except for marginal spacing to accommodate ancillary graphical user interface elements.,Definiteness requirement for patents mandates clarity while recognizing that absolute precision is unattainable.,Patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims read in light of the specification delineating the patent and the prosecution history fail to inform with reasonable certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.,Question as to whether patent claim describing computer-based method for distinguishing between scrolling and gesture operations on smartphone touch screen was invalid as anticipated was for jury in electronics manufacturers infringement suit against competitor.,To recover lost profits in an infringement case the patent owner must show causation in fact establishing that but for the infringement he would have made additional profits.,When seeking to recover lost profits in an infringement case the patent owner must take into account any alternatives available to the infringer and market sales of an acceptable noninfringing substitute often suffice alone to defeat a case for lost profits.,Competitor merely asserted existence of non-infringing smartphone devices but it did not assert that these devices constituted acceptable noninfringing substitute as required to defeat award to electronics manufacturer of lost profits in its patent infringement suit where of two devices cited by competitor one had significantly different features to manufacturers patented device such as slide-out physical keyboard in combination with small low-resolution screen and other one was never sold by any United States carrier.,Mere existence of a competing device does not make that device an acceptable substitute in analysis of whether to award patentee lost profits in an infringement case.,In damages retrial in electronics manufacturers patent infringement suit testimony of manufacturers expert provided sufficient evidence to support jurys reasonable royalty awards where expert had sufficiently explained her analysis of demand factor in lost profit context and she expressly testified that demand factor was also relevant to determination of reasonable royalty and she also expressly considered cost to competitor of being out of market long enough to design around patents profits attributable to competitors use of patented technology and commercial relationship between parties.,US Patent D593087 US Patent D604305 US Patent D618677.

Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded. ,In a patent case the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews decisions on motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law under the law of the regional circuit.,The Third Circuit reviews district court judgment as a matter of law decisions de novo.,On review of judgment as a matter of law in the Third Circuit the Court of Appeals views the record in the light most favorable to the verdict winner drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor only if the record is critically deficient of the minimum quantum of evidence on which a jury could reasonably base its verdict does the Third Circuit affirm a grant of JMOL but JMOL may be appropriate when there is a purely legal basis required for reversal that does not depend on rejecting the jurys findings on the evidence at trial.,Court could not second guess or reevaluate weight that jury gave to expert testimony to find that person of skill in the art would not have been motivated to combine prior art references to arrive at patent directed to small-sized portable and hand-held work station such as notebook computer that included camera unit data processing unit display user interface and at least one memory unit and thus patent was not invalid as obvious since finding was supported by substantial evidence. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,A patent is invalid as obvious if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,Patent obviousness is a question of law based on underlying facts what a particular reference discloses is a question of fact as is the question of whether there was a reason to combine certain references. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,The Graham factors for determining if a patent is invalid as obvious are 1 the scope and content of the prior art 2 the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention 3 the level of ordinary skill in the field of the invention and 4 any relevant objective considerations of nonobviousness. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,Although a court on a motion for judgment as a matter of law reviews any underlying findings of fact by the jury whether explicit or implicit for substantial evidence the ultimate determination of patent obviousness is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,When there is conflicting testimony at trial and the evidence overall does not make only one finding on the point reasonable the jury is permitted to make credibility determinations and believe the witness it considers more trustworthy.,Structures corresponding to claimed function of means for processing and storing in patent on camera phone encompassed only microprocessor 23 and memory unit 24 which were camera units processor and memory units since among other things language of claim made clear that means for processing and storing was part of camera unit not overall device and specification did not suggest that camera units processor and memory performed functions beyond processing and storing of image information for later recall. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Court of Appeals reviews a district courts claim construction de novo where it relied only on evidence intrinsic to the patent.,In a means-plus-function claim a disclosed structure is a corresponding structure only if the specification or prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The scope of a means-plus-function limitation is outlined not by what the patent specification and prosecution history do not say but rather by what they do say. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Camera module in accused product that did not have any internal memory for storing image data and thus did not have any structure corresponding to function of storing at least portion of processed image information did not literally infringe means for processing and storing limitation in patent on camera phone although main memory of accused product was camera units means for storing main memory was not located within camera module of accused product which was required by patent claim. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Literal infringement of a means-plus-function limitation requires that the relevant structure in the accused device perform the identical function recited in the claim and be identical or equivalent to the corresponding structure in the specification. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Patent directed to display of call handling options in menu on mobile phones display screen using one key was obvious on basis of prior art that disclosed telecommunications system that allowed users to make and receive phone calls from computer using two keys since skilled artisan would have found it obvious to take straightforward and commonsensical step to configure prior art to display window after pressing one key instead of two keys. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,Patent describing method for allowing user to reject incoming cellular telephone call when user already was active on another call by pressing a key was obvious on basis of prior protocols in global system for mobile communications GSM standard for cellular networks regarding fundamental interactions between mobile phones and mobile network and specific call waiting and call holding functions person with ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine prior GSM standards at time of alleged invention by following express cross-references to those protocols and using detailed table of contents to locate relevant sections because protocols were both part of same comprehensive GSM standard. 35 U.S.C.A.  103.,Phrase controlling the alert sound generator to change a volume of the generated alert sound by the control means in patent that disclosed communication device such as mobile phone that permitted user to stop ring-tone alert for incoming call without notifying caller encompassed both stopping and reducing volume of alert sound. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,A patent claim construction that would exclude a

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./086 - Virnetx Inc v Cisco Systems Inc.txt", Background Patentee brought action against mobile phone manufacturer alleging infringement of patents describing method of transparently creating virtual private network VPN between client computer and target computer and patents disclosing secure domain name service. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Leonard Davis Chief Judge 2009 WL 2370727 and 2012 WL 3135639 construed the claims and then denied manufacturers post-trial motions after jury returned verdict in patentees favor 925 F.Supp.2d 816. Manufacturer appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Chief Judge held that  1 term domain name meant name corresponding to Internet Protocol IP address  2 term secure communication link meant direct communication link that provided data security and anonymity  3 substantial evidence supported jury verdict that accused product met direct communication limitation  4 accused feature in mobile phone manufacturers product met determining whether limitation  5 substantial evidence supported jurys finding that feature in accused product created VPN or secure channel that extended from client to target computer  6 security provided by accused system that included encryption on insecure paths but otherwise relied on security provided by private networks was not equivalent to encrypted channel  7 patentee could not rely on entire market value of multi-component product containing several non-infringing features with no relation to patented feature to approximate reasonable royalty base and  8 evidence relying on 50-50 starting point based on bargaining solution theorem was not admissible.  Affirmed in part reversed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,Patent claim construction is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.,The process of construing a patent claim term begins with the words of the claims themselves however the claims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part.,The patent claim differentiation doctrine disfavors reading a limitation from a dependent claim into an independent claim.,Although courts are permitted to consider extrinsic evidence like expert testimony dictionaries and treatises when construing a patent claim term such evidence is generally of less significance than the intrinsic record.,Term domain name in patents that disclosed domain name service DNS system that resolved domain names and facilitates establishing secure communication links meant name corresponding to Internet Protocol IP address.,Term secure communication link in patents that disclosed domain name service DNS system that resolved domain names and facilitates establishing secure communication links meant direct communication link that provided data security and anonymity.,In a patent case the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law JMOL or a new trial under the law of the regional circuit.,The Fifth Circuit requires that a jurys determination must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.,Substantial evidence supported jury verdict that accused product met direct communication limitation in patents disclosing secure domain name service each claim required some indication that domain name service system supported establishing secure communication link relay server created two separate communications network address translators NAT used by accused products did not impede direct communication but operated like routers or firewalls and NAT router still allowed for end-to-end communication between the two devices because it merely translated addresses from public address space to private address space but did not terminate the connection.,Accused feature in mobile phone manufacturers product met determining whether limitation of patents generally describing method of transparently creating virtual private network VPN between client computer and target computer since manufacturers accused feature could be configured to infringe based on manufacturers internal documents and source code and determining whether step could be performed by comparing requested domain name against list of domain names while feature could initiate VPN connections with unsecure websites feature was not intended to be used in that manner and there was no requirement in claims for verification of security of requested website or server.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding that feature in accused product created VPN or secure channel that extended from client to target computer and thus literally infringed claim of patent that required creating secure channel between client and secure server path extending from virtual private network VPN server to target computer i.e. within private network would be secure and anonymous owing to protection provided by private network paths beyond VPN server could be rendered secure and anonymous by means of physical security present in private corporate networks and patentee did not have to prove that accused product did not have any non-infringing modes of operation.,Security provided by accused system that included encryption on insecure paths but otherwise relied on security provided by private networks was not equivalent to encrypted channel required by claim in patent that generally described method of transparently creating virtual private network VPN between client computer and target computer and thus accused product did not infringe under equivalents doctrine security of private network could not be equated with encryption provided by VPN server because encryption was narrower more specific requirement than security according to patent.,To find infringement under the equivalents doctrine any differences between the claimed invention and the accused product must be insubstantial insubstantiality may be determined by whether the accused device performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result as the patent claim limitation.,Under the equivalents doctrine whether an accused device performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result as the patent claim limitation is a question of fact.,Vitiation is not an exception to the doctrine of equivalents but instead is a legal determination that the evidence in a patent suit is such that no reasonable jury could determine two elements to be equivalent.,A party challenging the validity of a patent must establish invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.,Anticipation in a patent case is a factual question that is reviewed for substantial evidence.,A patent claim is anticipated only if each and every element is found within a single prior art reference arranged as claimed.,Substantial evidence supported finding that patents generally describing method of transparently creating a virtual private network VPN between a client computer and a target computer and patents disclosing secure domain name service were not invalid as anticipated patent owner presented evidence and testimony that prior publication failed to disclose several claim limitations including secure communication link virtual private network a DNS proxy server an encrypted channel and secure channel. 35 U.S.C.A.  102a.,District court would not have abused its discretion in finding that probative value of evidence that mobile phone manufacturer initiated re-examinations of patents generally describing method of transparently creating a virtual private network VPN between client computer and target computer and patents disclosing secure domain name service was substantially outweighed by risk of unfair prejudice to patentee confusion with invalidity on the merits or misleading jury thereby justifying exclusion in patent infringement action. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 403 28 U.S.C.A.,In a patent case regional circuit law is applied to evidentiary issues.,The Fifth Circuit reviews a district courts exclusion of relevant evidence on the basis that its probative value is substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice for clear abuse of discretion resulting in substantial prejudice. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 403 28 U.S.C.A.,Patentee could not rely on entire market value of multi-component product containing several non-infringing features with no relation to patented feature to approximate base for reasonable royalty that manufacturer of accused products would have been willing to offer to pay to patentee during hypothetical negotiation without attempting to apportion value attributable to patented features. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The most common method for determining a reasonable royalty is the hypothetical negotiation approach which attempts to ascertain the royalty upon which the parties would have agreed had they successfully negotiated an agreement just before patent infringement began. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,In a patent case a reasonable royalty may be a lump-sum payment not calculated on a per unit basis but it may also be and often is a running payment that varies with the number of infringing units in that event it generally has two prongs a royalty base and a royalty rate. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Whatever the form of the royalty a patentee must take care to seek only those damages attributable to the infringing features. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,When patent claims are drawn to an individual component of a multi-component product it is the exception not the rule that damages may be based upon the value of the multi-component product in the absence of a showing that the patented feature creates the basis for customer demand or substantially creates the value of the component parts principles of apportionment apply. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,When determining a reasonable royalty in a patent case absolute precision is not required when assigning value to a feature that may not have ever been individually sold this process may involve some degree of approximation and uncertainty. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Testimony of patentees damages expert that relied on entire value of accused devices and computers as smallest salable units without attempting to apportion value attributable to patented features was not admissible to approximate base for reasonable royalty that manufacturer of accused products would have been willing to offer to pay to patentee during hypothetical negotiation for failure to comport with settled principles of apportionment where smallest salable unit was multi-component product containing non-infringing features with no relation to patented feature patentee had to demonstrate that patented features drove demand for accused products. 35 U.S.C.A.  284 Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the principles laid out in Daubert v.

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./088 - Interval Licensing LLC v AOL Inc.txt", Background Patentee brought action against alleged infringers claiming infringement of its patents directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Marsha J. Pechman J. 2013 WL 792791 construed patent terms and found the patents invalid. The patentee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Chen Circuit Judge held that  1 the patent phrase unobtrusive manner that does not distract a user was indefinite  2 the term attention manager meant a system that displays images to a user either when the user is not engaged in a primary interaction or in an area of the display screen that is not used by the users primary activity and  3 the term instructions meant a statement that specifies a function to be performed by a system.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,A claim fails to satisfy the statutory requirement to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the applicant regards as the invention and is thus invalid for indefiniteness if its language when read in light of the specification and the prosecution history fails to inform with reasonable certainty those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Court of Appeals reviews the district courts determination that a patent term is indefinite de novo.,Although absolute or mathematical precision is not required to satisfy the definiteness requirement for a term-of-degree phrase in a patent claim it is not enough to identify some standard for measuring the scope of the phrase. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The phrase unobtrusive manner that does not distract a user in patents directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device failed to inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention with reasonable certainty and thus patent claims that depended on that phrase were invalid for indefiniteness where the phrase had too uncertain a relationship to the patents embodiments to provide definition and an example in the patents specification was not an exclusive definition of the phrase. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,On an allegation of indefiniteness a term of degree fails to provide sufficient notice of its scope if it depends on the unpredictable vagaries of any one persons opinion. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Court of Appeals reviews patent claim construction de novo.,The words of a patent claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning which is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.,Claim language in a patent must be viewed in light of the specification which is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.,In addition to consulting a patents specification a court may also consider the prosecution history and any relevant extrinsic evidence in resolving the meaning of a disputed patent term.,Term attention manager in a patent directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device meant a system that displays images to a user either when the user is not engaged in a primary interaction or in an area of the display screen that is not used by the users primary activity.,Term instructions in a patent directed to an attention manager for occupying the peripheral attention of a person in the vicinity of a display device meant a statement that specifies a function to be performed by a system.,In the interest of judicial economy the Court of Appeals has the discretion to review a non-dispositive patent claim construction if the Court believes that the construction may become important on remand.,US Patent 6034652.

"../../files/WestLaw/Apple, Inc./096 - Apple Inc v Motorola Inc.txt", Background In patent infringement action between manufacturers of smartphones both parties sought declaratory judgments of non-infringement and invalidity of patents related to smartphone technology. Following claim construction the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Richard A. Posner Circuit Judge 2012 WL 1959560 excluded damages experts and 869 F.Supp.2d 901 granted summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to certain claims. Cross-appeals were taken.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Reyna Circuit Judge held that  1 term heuristic meant one or more rules to be applied to data to assist in drawing inferences from that data  2 term analyzer server meant a server routine separate from a client that receives data having structures from the client  3 term realtime application program interface API meant an API that allows realtime interaction between two or more subsystems  4 accused device did not infringe patent disclosing system for encrypting data communications  5 experts testimony regarding reasonable royalty rate was admissible  6 fact issues precluded summary judgment on damages and  7 patentee was not entitled to injunction for infringement of patent related to smartphone technology.  Affirmed in part reversed in part vacated in part and remanded.  Rader Chief Judge filed an opinion dissenting-in-part.  Prost Circuit Judge filed an opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part. ,Claim construction is a question of law that the Court of Appeals reviews de novo.,Whether patent claim language invokes the statute governing means-plus-function limitations is a question of law that the Court of Appeals reviews de novo. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The overall means-plus-function analysis is a two-step process in the first step the court must determine if the claim limitation is drafted in means-plus-function format in the second step if the limitation is in means-plus-function format the court must specifically review the specification for corresponding structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When determining if the claim limitation is drafted in means-plus-function format the court must construe the claim limitation to decide if it connotes sufficiently definite structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art which requires the court to consider the specification. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When determining whether a patent claim is a means-plus-function claim it is possible to find that a claim limitation does not connote sufficiently definite structure despite the presence of some corresponding structure in the specification. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Not every mean-plus-function limitation is indefinite only those that lack the term means do not connote sufficiently definite structure and lack corresponding structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When a claim limitation lacks the term means it creates a rebuttable presumption that the statute governing means-plus-function limitations does not apply. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The rebuttable presumption that the statute governing means-plus-function limitations does not apply may be overcome if the claim fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or merely recites a function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Whether to draft a patent claim in broad structural terms is the claim drafters choice and any resulting risk that emanates from that choice is not a basis for the court to rewrite a claim in means-plus-function format. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The correct inquiry when determining whether statute governing means-plus-function limitations applies when means is absent from a limitation is whether the limitation read in light of the remaining claim language specification prosecution history and relevant extrinsic evidence has sufficiently definite structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When determining whether statute governing means-plus-function limitations applies structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art of computer-implemented inventions may differ from more traditional mechanical structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For purposes of determining whether statute governing means-plus-function limitations applies when means is absent from a limitation a limitation has sufficient structure when it recites a claim term with a structural definition that is either provided in the specification or generally known in the art. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For purposes of determining whether statute governing means-plus-function limitations applies when means is absent from a limitation structure may be provided by describing the claim limitations operation such as its input output or connections. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The means-plus-function limitations operation is more than just its function it is how the function is achieved in the context of the invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Even if a patentee elects to use a generic claim term such as a nonce word or a verbal construct properly construing that term in view of the specification prosecution history etc. may still provide sufficient structure such that the presumption against means-plus-function claiming remains intact. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When determining whether statute governing means-plus-function limitations applies when means is absent from a limitation the limitation need not connote a single specific structure rather it may describe a class of structures. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Even if the patent describes all structures that perform the recited function this by itself does not overcome the strong presumption that means-plus-function claiming does not apply when the term means is not recited in the claim. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,If the claim merely recites a generic nonce word and the remaining claim language specification prosecution history and relevant external evidence provide no further structural description to a person of ordinary skill in the art then the presumption against means-plus-function claiming is rebutted. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,If a claim recites a generic term that properly construed in light of the specification lacks sufficiently definite structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art the presumption that the statute governing means-plus-function limitations does not apply is overcome and the patentee has invoked means-plus-function claiming. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Term heuristic in patent disclosing use of finger contacts to control a touchscreen computer meant one or more rules to be applied to data to assist in drawing inferences from that data.,Term analyzer server in patent disclosing system for recognizing certain structures such as a telephone number on a touchscreen and then linking certain actions such as calling the telephone number to the structure meant a server routine separate from a client that receives data having structures from the client.,Term linking actions to the detected structures in patent disclosing system for recognizing certain structures such as a telephone number on a touchscreen and then linking certain actions such as calling the telephone number to the structure meant creating a specified connection between each detected structure and at least one computer subroutine that causes the CPU to perform a sequence of operations on that detected structure.,Term realtime application program interface API in patent disclosing system for processing data in realtime meant an API that allows realtime interaction between two or more subsystems.,In patent disclosing method for generating preamble sequences which were used in communications between cell phones and base stations third step of multiplying the outer code by the inner code could not occur until after the first two steps forming an outer code and forming an inner code were completed.,Steps in a method claim need not necessarily be performed in the order they are written on the other hand if grammar logic the specification or the prosecution history require the steps to be performed sequentially then the claims are so limited.,In patent disclosing system for encrypting data communications claimed transmit overflow sequence number or TOSN was never transmitted to the receiver in the claimed system and thus accused device did not infringe patent where counterpart to TOSN in accused products was transmitted to the receiver.,Statements made in unrelated patent applications are not relevant to claim construction.,When construing claim terms in patent disclosing system for encrypting data communications district court could rely on statements before the Japan patent office during prosecution of related patent statements were made in official proceeding in which patentee had every incentive to exercise care in characterizing scope of its invention two patents were related and shared familial relationship both specifications were the same and at time patentee made its statements to Japanese patent office Japanese application contained identical claim.,Under the rules governing admission of expert testimony and precedent a district court judge acting as a gatekeeper may exclude evidence if it is based upon unreliable principles or methods or legally insufficient facts and data. Fed.Rules Evid.Rules 702 703 28 U.S.C.A.,When deciding whether to admit expert testimony a judge must be cautious not to overstep its gatekeeping role and weigh facts evaluate the correctness of conclusions impose its own preferred methodology or judge credibility including the credibility of one expert over another these tasks are solely reserved for the fact finder.

Following jury verdict in its favor patentee moved for a permanent injunction to prohibit competitor from infringing contributing to the infringement or inducing the infringement of any of its patents. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Lucy H. Koh J. 909 F.Supp.2d 1147 denied motion. Patentee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit Judge held that  1 patentee was required to show a causal nexus in order to demonstrate irreparable harm in seeking a permanent injunction  2 evidence of ease of use or copying by competitor was insufficient to establish causal nexus required to support permanent injunction  3 district court should have considered evidence purporting to show that consumers would be willing to pay fairly significant price premiums for features claimed in utility patents in determining whether to grant injunction  4 district court failed to consider all evidence in determining that money damages were adequate  5 determination that balance of hardships factor was neutral was not abuse of discretion  6 determination that public interest did not support grant of permanent injunction was not abuse of discretion and  7 denial of a permanent injunction against competitors dilution of patentees trade dress was not abuse of discretion.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate 1 that it has suffered an irreparable injury 2 that remedies available at law such as monetary damages are inadequate to compensate for that injury 3 that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant a remedy in equity is warranted and 4 that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.,An injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy which should not be granted as a matter of course.,If a less drastic remedy is sufficient to redress a plaintiffs injury no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an injunction is warranted.,The decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.,Court of Appeals may find a district court abused its discretion in granting or denying injunctive relief on a showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings.,To the extent the district courts decision whether to grant injunctive relief is based upon an issue of law Court of Appeals reviews that issue de novo.,There is no presumption of irreparable harm for purposes of determining whether injunctive relief is warranted upon a finding of patent infringement.,Patentee was required to show a causal nexus between competitors infringement of its smartphone design patents and harm it suffered as a result of competitors infringement in order to demonstrate irreparable harm in seeking a permanent injunction barring competitor from infringing on patents. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,The standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.,Patentee was not required to show that one of the patented features was the sole reason that consumers purchased competitors infringing products in order to show causal nexus necessary to demonstrate irreparable harm in seeking a permanent injunction barring competitor from selling its infringing devices.,Patentee was not foreclosed from analyzing its alleged harm based on aggregate viewing of its patents in seeking to demonstrate irreparable harm supporting a permanent injunction barring competitor from selling its infringing devices.,District courts decision on motion for permanent injunction against infringement of patents related to smartphone features that patentee failed to establish causal nexus between infringement of its design patents and its alleged irreparable harm by loss of market share and loss of downstream and future sales was not abuse of discretion isolated anecdotal statements about single design elements did not establish that patentees broader patented designs were drivers of consumer demand. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,Evidence of ease of use or copying by competitor offered by patentee on motion for permanent injunction against infringement of patents related to smartphone features although relevant was too general standing alone to establish a causal nexus between infringement of patentees utility patents and its alleged irreparable harm by loss of market share and loss of downstream and future sales. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,District court should have considered patentees experts survey evidence purporting to show that consumers would be willing to pay fairly significant price premiums for the features claimed in utility patents related to smartphone features in determining whether to grant patentees motion for permanent injunction against infringement of patents. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,Unlike a patent infringers inability to pay a judgment which may demonstrate the inadequacy of damages in determining whether to grant permanent injunction a defendants ability to pay a judgment does not defeat a claim that an award of damages would be an inadequate remedy.,A defendants ability to pay a damages award in a patent infringement action merely indicates that a court should look to other considerations to determine whether a damages award will adequately compensate the patentee for the harm caused by continuing infringement or whether patentee is entitled to a permanent injunction.,In determining that money damages were adequate and thus that such factor weighed against award of permanent injunction against infringement of patents related to smartphone features district court improperly focused exclusively on whether patentees patents were priceless and whether competitor was off limits as a licensing partner district court should also have considered patentees evidence that competitors use of its patents was different than use granted through licenses. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,District courts determination that balance of hardships factor was neutral on patentees motion for a permanent injunction against infringement of patents was not abuse of discretion where neither party would be greatly harmed by either outcome and finding that competitors willfulness tipped the balance of hardships in patentees favor would result in an impermissible use of an injunction as punishment. 35 U.S.C.A.  283.,District courts determination on patentees motion for a permanent injunction against infringement of patents that public interest did not support grant of permanent injunction was not abuse of discretion although public had an interest in preserving the rights of patent holders the injunction sought was extremely broad and would prevent the sale of products based on limited non-core infringing features. 35

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is proper when complaint either 1 lacks a cognizable legal theory or 2 fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,To survive motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to state claim to relief that is plausible on its face claim is facially plausible when plaintiff pleads factual content that allows court to draw reasonable inference that defendant is liable for misconduct alleged. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Plausibility requires pleading facts as opposed to conclusory allegations or formulaic recitation of elements of cause of action and must rise above mere conceivability or possibility of unlawful conduct that entitles pleader to relief. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Where complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with defendants liability it stops short of line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief nor is it enough that complaint is factually neutral rather it must be factually suggestive.

After a jury verdict in manufacturers favor manufacturer moved for permanent injunction and enhanced damages and competitor moved to seal manufacturers market reports. The District Court Koh J. 2012 WL 5988570 denied motion. Parties appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit Judge held that  1 parties were entitled to interlocutory review of district courts unsealing orders  2 district court applied incorrect standard when determining whether to seal documents  3 district court abused its discretion in refusing to seal parties confidential financial information and  4 district court abused its discretion in refusing to seal manufacturers market reports.  Reversed and remanded. ,The collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the final judgment rule that permits the appeal of trial court orders affecting rights that will be irretrievably lost in the absence of an immediate appeal.,To fall within the collateral order doctrine exception to the final judgment rule an order must at a minimum satisfy three conditions it must 1 conclusively determine the disputed question 2 resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and 3 be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.,Parties were entitled to interlocutory review of district courts unsealing orders in patent infringement action unsealing orders conclusively determined that parties confidential information would be made public orders presented an important issue because they addressed the important balance between the publics interest in understanding judicial proceedings and the parties right to access the courts without being unduly required to disclose confidential information propriety of sealing court documents was an issue wholly separate from the merits of the action and orders would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment because once the parties confidential information was made publicly available it could not be made secret again.,Where an appeal does not involve substantive issues of patent law Court of Appeals apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district court sits.,When reviewing a district courts order sealing or unsealing judicial records the Court of Appeals reviews de novo whether the district court used the correct legal standard.,A district courts decision to seal or unseal judicial records is reviewed for abuse of discretion.,The general right to inspect and copy public records and documents including judicial records and documents extends to pretrial documents filed in civil cases.,Although the common law right of access is not absolute in reviewing a district courts decision whether to seal judicial records Court of Appeals starts with a strong presumption in favor of access to court records.,A party seeking to seal judicial records can overcome the strong presumption of access by providing sufficiently compelling reasons that override the public policies favoring disclosure the party must articulate compelling reasons supported by specific factual findings that outweigh the general history of access and the public policies favoring disclosure such as the public interest in understanding the judicial process.,When ruling on a motion to seal court records a court must conscientiously balance the competing interests of the public and the party who seeks to keep certain judicial records secret.,One factor that weighs in favor of sealing documents is when the release of the documents will cause competitive harm to a business.,A trade secret may consist of any formula pattern device or compilation of information which is used in ones business and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Restatement First of Torts  757 comment.,An exception to the presumption of access to judicial records exists for judicial records filed under seal when attached to a non-dispositive motion.,A particularized showing of good cause under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure governing duty to disclose is sufficient to preserve the secrecy of sealed discovery documents attached to non-dispositive motions. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 26c 28 U.S.C.A.,The public has less of a need for access to court records attached only to non-dispositive motions because those documents are often unrelated or only tangentially related to the underlying cause of action.,Good cause standard rather than compelling reasons standard should have been applied in determining whether to seal documents attached to nondispositive motions filed in patent infringement action. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 26c 28 U.S.C.A.,District courts refusal to seal parties confidential financial information which was attached to pretrial motions in patent infringement action involving cellular phones and computer tablets was abuse of discretion parties could suffer competitive harm if the information were made public and public had only a minimal interest in the parties confidential financial information which was not even considered by the jury at trial.,District courts refusal to seal cellular phone and computer tablet manufacturers confidential market research reports pages of which were attached to competitors opposition to manufacturer post-trial motion for permanent injunction and enhanced damages in patent infringement action was abuse of discretion manufacturer had a strong interest in keeping its market reports confidential and public had minimal interest in information not relied upon by competitor in its opposition to the post-trial motion.

faster approach.,Provisional patent application that was used to find anticipated a claim of patent pertaining to smartphone touchscreens that disclosed touch panel with transparent capacitive sensing medium capable of detecting multiple touches at once did not incorporate by reference anticipatory subject matter from another provisional application and therefore anticipation finding by International Trade Commission ITC lacked substantial evidence provisional application made only passing reference to purported incorporated material as method similar for detecting presence of stylus and did not refer to functionality that detected presence of stylus let alone process that output touch event information to form pixilated image required by allegedly anticipated patent claim.,For a prior art reference to anticipate a claim of a patent the reference must disclose each claim limitation in a single document.,Prior art document may incorporate subject matter by reference to another

patentees secondary considerations evidence.,Ultimate conclusion of obviousness of patent claims is a legal conclusion to be reached after weighing all the evidence on both sides.,Failure of International Trade Commission ITC to evaluate secondary considerations evidence prior to making obviousness determination as to patent pertaining to smartphone touchscreens was not harmless error where patentee presented compelling secondary considerations evidence that might have rebutted even strong showing under other factors of obviousness test including examples of industry praise by

evidence patentees evidence of industry copying of multitouch screen and industry praise of that feature were strong evidence of nexus and contrary cursory statement of technical expert for alleged infringer was insufficient to support finding of no nexus.,As used in claims of patent pertaining to smartphone touchscreens that disclosed method to determine whether displaced charge at touchscreen

../../files/WestLaw/Exxon Mobil/119 - Exxon Mobil Corp v FERC.txt, Background Independent electric power generators and public utility companies petitioned for review of orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC 2007 WL 178594 2007 WL 1655300 challenging FERCs application of its interconnection pricing policies.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Griffith Circuit Judge held that  1 section of Federal Power Act setting forth limited time for which refund could be ordered for amounts paid in excess of reasonable rate was applicable to interconnecting generators claims challenging classification of facilities and seeking transmission service credits equal to amount paid to fund construction of facilities  2 to establish that FERC violated provision of Act requiring it to act as speedily as possible upon institution of proceeding challenging a rate and to state reasons for its delay generators were required to show they suffered harm as a result of FERCs failure to keep them informed rather than as a result of FERCs delay and  3 utilities lacked standing to challenge FERCs orders.  Generators petitions denied utilities petitions dismissed. ,The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC may not retroactively alter a filed rate under the Federal Power Act FPA to compensate for prior over or underpayments. Federal Power Act  205d 16 U.S.C.A.  824d.,The filed rate doctrine forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.,The rule against retroactive ratemaking and the filed rate doctrine generally limit the relief that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC may order to prospective remedies.,Public utilities are required to provide open access to their transmission lines on nondiscriminatory terms to any independent entity that generates or purchases electricity.,Any interconnection agreement between a utility and an interconnecting generator that improperly classifies a Network Upgrade must be corrected and the generator that paid for the facility is entitled to transmission service credits.,Review of decisions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is deferential and the Court of Appeals will affirm so long as FERC made a reasoned decision based upon substantial evidence and the path of its reasoning is clear. 5 U.S.C.A.  7062.,Section of Federal Power Act setting forth limited time for which refund could be ordered for amounts paid in excess of reasonable rate was applicable to interconnecting electric power generators claims challenging classification of facilities and seeking transmission service credits equal to amount paid to fund construction of facilities and thus Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC was not authorized to provide generators with full credits they would have received had facilities been properly classified initially despite contention that upfront construction payments were loan to utilities and that generators were seeking reimbursement not refund of past rates FERC only had power to order repayment of unreasonable rates not reimbursement of loans. Federal Power Act  206a b 16 U.S.C.A.  824ea b.,Refunds of any amounts paid outside of the refund period as set forth in the section of the Federal Power Act governing the relief the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC may order for amounts paid in excess of a just and reasonable rate are forbidden. Federal Power Act  206b 16 U.S.C.A.  824eb.,When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is fashioning remedies the Court of Appeals is particularly deferential.,To establish that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC violated provision of Federal Power Act requiring it to act as speedily as possible upon the institution of a proceeding challenging a rate and to state the reasons for its delay if it did not issue a final decision within 180 days after the initiation of the proceeding electric power generators were required to show that they suffered harm as a result of FERCs failure to keep them informed rather than as a result of FERCs delay. Federal Power Act  206b 16 U.S.C.A.  824eb.,Court of Appeals lacked authority to consider claims of electric power generator seeking to recover from utilities funds paid to cover cost to interconnect to utilities transmission systems where generator did not raise claims in proceedings below before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. Federal Power Act  313b 16 U.S.C.A.  825lb.,A party can obtain judicial review of an order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC if it can establish both the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing.,To establish constitutional standing a petitioner must show an actual or imminent injury in fact fairly traceable to the challenged agency action that will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.,Utilities claim that orders of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC required them to modify their interconnection agreements and provide electric power generators with transmission credits did not establish an injury in fact as required for standing to obtain judicial review of FERCs orders since utilities were not actually obligated to issue any credits because FERC decreased the initial award of credits by rate payments made by generators outside of the statutory refund period and those payments exceeded the initial award of credits. Federal Power Act  206b 16 U.S.C.A.  824eb.,Possibility that affirmance of Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERCs orders awarding electric power generators a partial refund of funds paid to cover cost of interconnecting to utilities transmission systems might collaterally estop utilities from challenging a similar remedy in the future did not constitute an injury in fact and thus utilities lacked standing to obtain judicial review of FERCs orders.,The Court of Appeals will not consider a theory of standing first presented to it at oral argument.

Objecting class members appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Hug Circuit Judge held that  1 cy pres remedy included in settlement provided for next best distribution to class  2 presence of networks employee on board of directors of charity organization that was to be set up using cy pres funds did not preclude approval of settlement as fair reasonable and adequate  3 that settlement agreement provided for creation of new grant-making entity rather than providing for cy pres funds to be given to already-existing organization did not preclude approval of settlement as fair reasonable and adequate  4 conclusion that settlement amount was substantial was not abuse of discretion and  5 notice of proposed settlement satisfied rule.  Affirmed.  Kleinfeld Circuit Judge filed a dissenting opinion. ,Appellate review of fairness determination made by district court in approving class-action settlement is extremely limited and Court of Appeals will set aside that determination only upon a strong showing that district courts decision was a clear abuse of discretion. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Both district court and Court of Appeals must evaluate the fairness of a class-action settlement as a whole rather than assessing its individual components. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Question of whether class-action settlement is fundamentally fair within meaning of governing rule is different from question of whether settlement is perfect in the estimation of reviewing court. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Although class action rule imposes strict procedural requirements on the approval of a class settlement district courts only role in reviewing the substance of that settlement is to ensure that it is fair adequate and free from collusion. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23 28 U.S.C.A.,Number of factors guide district court in determining whether class-action settlement is fair adequate and free from collusion including 1 strength of plaintiffs case 2 risk expense complexity and likely duration of further litigation 3 risk of maintaining class action status throughout trial 4 amount offered in settlement 5 extent of discovery completed and stage of proceedings 6 experience and views of counsel 7 presence of governmental participant and 8 reaction of class members to proposed settlement. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,When class-action settlement takes place before formal class certification settlement approval requires a higher standard of fairness to ensure that class representatives and their counsel do not secure disproportionate benefit at the expense of unnamed plaintiffs whom class counsel had duty to represent. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,When reviewing district courts approval of class-action settlement reached before formal class certification Court of Appeals will not affirm if it appears that district court did not evaluate settlement sufficiently to account for possibility that class representatives and their counsel have sacrificed interests of absent class members for their own benefit. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,A cy pres remedy sometimes called fluid recovery is a settlement structure wherein class members receive an indirect benefit usually through defendant donations to a third party rather than a direct monetary payment.,For purposes of the cy pres doctrine a class-action settlement fund is non-distributable when the proof of individual claims would be burdensome or distribution of damages costly.,District courts review of a class-action settlement that calls for a cy pres remedy is not substantively different from that of any other class-action settlement except that the court should not find the settlement fair adequate and reasonable unless the cy pres remedy accounts for the nature of the plaintiffs lawsuit the objectives of the underlying statutes and the interests of the silent class members. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Cy pres doctrine does not require that settling parties select a cy pres recipient that the court or class members would find ideal and instead requirement that cy pres remedy must be next best distribution of settlement funds absent direct monetary payment to absent class members means only that district court should not approve cy pres distribution unless it bears substantial nexus to interests of class members.,Cy pres remedy included in settlement of members class action against online social network and participants in network program that had updated members network personal profiles to reflect their actions on participants websites pursuant to which approximately 6500000 would be used for charity organization that would fund and sponsor programs to educate users and others regarding online privacy issues bore direct and substantial nexus to interests of absent class members and thus provided for next best distribution to class members alleged violations of state and federal privacy statutes direct monetary payments to class members were infeasible given de minimis recovery and organizations distributions would promote causes of online privacy and security that would benefit absent class members and serve purposes of underlying privacy statutes. 18 U.S.C.A.  1030 2510 2710 Wests Ann.Cal.Civ.Code  1750 Wests Ann.Cal.Penal Code  502.,Settlement agreement in class action brought by members against online social network and participants in network program that had updated members network personal profiles to reflect actions taken by members on participants websites could be approved as fair reasonable and adequate even though settlement provided for network employee to be on board of directors of charity organization that was to be set up using settlements cy pres funds and was to fund and sponsor programs to educate users and others regarding online privacy issues that network retained and would use its say in how cy pres funds would be distributed so as to ensure that funds were not used in way that harmed network was unremarkable result of parties give-and-take negotiations.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,While a district court must of course assess plaintiffs claims in determining the strength of their case relative to the risks of continued litigation in deciding whether to approve proposed class-action settlement it need not include in its approval order a specific finding of fact as to the potential recovery for each of plaintiffs causes of action. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,In deciding whether to approve proposed class-action settlement district court acted properly in evaluating strength of plaintiffs case in its entirety rather than on claim-by-claim basis.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23b3 28 U.S.C.A.,Even if online social networks program underlying members class action against network and other participants in program was already effectively terminated at the time settlement in class action was reached provision of settlement mandating programs permanent termination offered meaningful relief to class members given that absent judicially enforceable agreement network was free to revive program whenever it wanted. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Notice of proposed class-action settlement provided pursuant to rule must generally describe the terms of the settlement in sufficient detail to alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and to come forward and be heard a standard which does not require detailed analysis of the statutes or causes of action forming the basis for plaintiff classs claims or require an estimate of the potential value of those claims. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 23e 28 U.S.C.A.,Notice of proposed class-action settlement involving a cy pres remedy need not name the individuals sitting on the cy pres recipients board of directors even if one of those individuals has some association with defendants in the case.

../../files/WestLaw/Johnson and Johnson/13 - Smith v Johnson and Johnson.txt, Background Employee who worked as a senior professional sales representative for a pharmaceutical company brought action against her employer seeking overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey Jose L. Linares J. 2008 WL 5427802 granted summary judgment in favor of employer. Employee appealed and employer cross-appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Greenberg Circuit Judge held that employee fell within the administrative employee exemption to FLSAs overtime provisions.  Judgment affirmed cross-appeal dismissed. ,Employer which argued before the district court that employee was not entitled to overtime pay because she was exempt from FLSA under either the outside salesman exemption or the administrative employee exemption was not required to file a cross-appeal to urge the Court of Appeals to affirm judgment in favor of employer which was granted on the basis of the administrative employee exemption on the alternate basis of the outside salesman exemption and thus dismissal of cross-appeal as superfluous was warranted. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  13a1 29 U.S.C.A.  213a1.,A party without taking a cross-appeal may urge in support of an order from which an appeal has been taken any matter appearing in the record at least if the party relied on it in the district court.,Administrative employee exemption to FLSAs overtime provisions was applicable to senior professional sales representative for pharmaceutical company non-manual position required representative to form a strategic plan designed to maximize sales in her territory it involved a high level of planning and foresight representative executed nearly all of her duties without direct oversight and she described herself as the manager of her own business who could run her own territory as she saw fit. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  13a1 29 U.S.C.A.  213a1 29 C.F.R.  541.200541.204.,The FLSA is remedial and is construed broadly but exemptions to it are construed narrowly i.e. against the employer. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  1 et seq. 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq.,The Secretary of Labors regulations defining and delimiting the terms of the FLSAs exemptions have controlling weight unless found to be arbitrary capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  1 et seq. 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq.,Contention of employees counsel that employee overinflated her importance during her deposition when describing her position and that her statements were mere puffery did not warrant disregarding the deposition testimony when ruling on employers motion for summary judgment in employees suit seeking overtime pay under the FLSA as employee surely understood the significance of her testimony in the context of her case. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938  1 et seq. 29 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq.,Under the sham affidavit doctrine a court will disregard an affidavit inconsistent with an affiants prior deposition testimony when a party moves for summary judgment on the basis of the deposition unless the party relying on the affidavit in opposition to the motion can present a legitimate reason for the discrepancies between the deposition and the affidavit.

../../files/WestLaw/Johnson and Johnson/21 - Cordis Corp v Medtronic Ave Inc.txt, Background Owner of patents for coronary stents brought actions against competitors alleging infringement. Cases were consolidated. After jury found that one competitors accused stents infringed the district Court granted judgment as a matter of law of noninfringement. The Court of Appeals 339 F.3d 1352 reversed and remanded. On remand the United States District Court for the District of Delaware Sue L. Robinson J. 2005 WL 885381 431 F.Supp.2d 442 431 F.Supp.2d 461 and 431 F.Supp.2d 465denied competitors motions for new trial and for judgment as matter of law and invalidated claim that jury found to have been infringed. Parties appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Bryson Circuit Judge held that  1 accused coronary stent with round crowns of substantially same diameter met substantially uniform thickness limitation  2 trial courts treatment of methodology issue as question of fact could not have prejudiced competitor  3 testimony of engineering expert constituted substantial evidence that accused coronary stent with round crowns infringed patents if mode of measuring wall thickness was treated as part of factual component of infringement inquiry  4 connector members themselves did not have to be flexible  5 jury reasonably could have concluded that competitors stents had connector members that satisfied flexibly connect limitation  6 district court properly could bar competitor and its experts from telling jury that prior opinion of Court of Appeals supported competitors theory as to proper manner to measure thickness of walls of competitors stents  7 statements from counsel of patent owner during closing argument were not prejudicially misleading and  8 counsels statements taken in context which appeared to be principally directed to underscoring disagreement between patent owner and competitor over proper way to determine whether stent met substantially uniform thickness limitation were highly unlikely to have had such prejudicial effect as to deny fair trial to competitor.  Affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded. ,Accused coronary stent with round crowns of substantially same diameter met substantially uniform thickness limitation of patents for coronary stents although thickness of wall diminished in tapered end of crown.,Even though court would have been justified in refusing to permit competitor to introduce evidence regarding its theory as to how to measure wall thickness for coronary stents trial courts treatment of methodology issue as question of fact could not have prejudiced competitor as required for new trial where court gave opportunity to competitor to present its theory to jury.,Testimony of engineering expert constituted substantial evidence that accused coronary stent with round crowns infringed patents for coronary stents if mode of measuring wall thickness was treated as part of factual component of infringement inquiry where expert testified that engineer would have determined thickness of stent wall by measuring thickness of struts which were uniformly thick and that rounding of edges would not affect his analysis.,Connector members themselves did not have to be flexible under flexibly connect adjacent tubular members language of claim in patents for coronary stents as construed by district court to require connector members to provide flexibility.,Jury reasonably could have concluded that competitors stents had connector members that satisfied flexibly connect limitation in patents for coronary stents even if connector members themselves were not flexible although competitor had concerns about assumptions and data that patent owners mechanical engineering expert used in his analysis competitor was free to and did present those concerns to jury and jury was entitled to credit experts testimony notwithstanding criticism of experts methodology. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,District court properly could bar competitor and its experts from telling jury that prior opinion of Court of Appeals supported competitors theory as to proper manner to measure thickness of walls of competitors stents in patent infringement trial regarding coronary stents since relevant portion of opinion did not reflect agreement by Court of Appeals with competitors theory as to how to measure thickness of stent wall and it was for court not jury to interpret prior opinion of Court of Appeals.,Statements from counsel of patent owner during closing argument were not prejudicially misleading which criticized competitors method of measuring thickness by referring to competitors method of measurement as utterly misleading analysis big trick and intellectually dishonest and argued that competitor was misusing the concentric circles since statements were made in context of arguments for why method of patent owner provided more rational approach to determining thickness and its arguments were rooted in record evidence.,Counsels statements taken in context which appeared to be principally directed to underscoring disagreement between patent owner and competitor over proper way to determine whether stent met substantially uniform thickness limitation were highly unlikely to have had such prejudicial effect as to deny fair trial to competitor although those statements could have been read to suggest that no reduction in thickness no matter how great could have exceeded maximum 100 percent variation permitted by wall thickness limitation as construed.,Argument in which counsel for patent owner told jury that you cant have a stent that goes up a hundred percent was highly unlikely to have had such prejudicial effect as to deny fair infringement trial to competitor where context of remark made it clear that counsel was not saying it was impossible to have stent with 100 percent variation in thickness but instead he was saying that stent could not have wall surface that varied by more than 100 percent and still fall within reach of patent.,Evidence demonstrating clinical advantages of tapered crowns on competitors stents was not relevant to question of infringement of patents for coronary stents since jury had been asked to determine whether competitors stents infringed patent not whether stents performed better than patents preferred embodiment.,Jury instruction in patent case proposed by competitor to which competitor did not object but subsequently challenged on appeal either constituted invited error that was not reviewable at all or at most was subject to review under plain error standard.,Under Third Circuit law to which the Federal Circuit looks for the standard to apply when reviewing claimed instructional errors in a patent case from a district court in that circuit at a minimum it must be shown that any error in an obviousness instruction was fundamental and highly prejudicial or that the instructions are such that the jury was without adequate guidance on a fundamental question and failure to consider the error would result in a miscarriage of justice.,Plain error standard applied to jury instruction on obviousness of patent to which no objection was made even in the case of change in the law.,Generic term slots as used in claim covering coronary stents with wall surface having plurality of slots formed therein the slots being disposed substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member referred to both complete slots and half slots although written description used more specific phrase complete slots when distinguishing complete slots from half slots.,Claim in patents for coronary stents reciting graft comprising tubular member not graft consisting of single tubular member was not precluded from covering grafts that were constructed by linking multiple tubular members any one of which by itself might not have been capable of preventing vessel collapse.,Substantial evidence supported finding of literal infringement as to wall surface limitation in patents for coronary stents where tubular member limitation read on U-shaped portions along accused stents surface and those portions did not prevent tubular member from literally infringing wall surface limitation.,Jury reasonably could conclude that presence of weld spots on accused stents surface did not sufficiently alter cylindrical character of outer surface to preclude finding of literal infringement of wall surface limitation in patents for coronary stents where evidence was presented that each tubular section only had one weld spot weld spots did not rise significantly above wall surface of accused stent and taken together made up only about one percent of total area of stents metal outer surface.,Prosecution history estoppel did not apply to bar application of equivalents doctrine with respect to wall surface limitation in patents for coronary stents by making meaning of term wall surface explicit that already was implicit in patent.,An applicant can make a binding disavowal of claim scope in the course of prosecuting the patent through arguments made to distinguish prior art references however such argument-based disavowals will be found only if they constitute clear and unmistakable surrenders of subject matter and the scope of such a disavowal will depend on the nature of the argument made by the patentee.,In order to constitute binding surrenders of claim scope the statements in question must be such that a competitor would reasonably believe that the patent applicant had surrendered the relevant subject matter.,If a court finds that the patentee made a clear disavowal of the subject matter that is subsequently asserted to be equivalent to the limitation in question it will preclude the patentee from asserting equivalency as to that subject matter.,Patentee disavowed wall surface such as that in prior art sleeve but it did not disavow any equivalents to wall surface disposed in a common cylindrical plane by noting that prior art sleeve had no comparable wall surface to one disposed in a common cylindrical plane and thus prosecution history estoppel did not apply to bar application of equivalents doctrine.,Reasonable jury would have had to conclude that accused stent literally infringed smooth surface limitation in patents for coronary stents where accused stent was capable of intraluminal delivery and reference in prosecution history characterized accused stent itself as smooth.,Patentee intended for term smooth in patents for coronary stents to be defined functionally so that stent would be considered smooth if it was smooth enough to be capable of intraluminal delivery although patentee also referred to term smooth as meaning not rough i.e. not having bumps projections etc. patentee made clear at several points in prosecution history that concept of roughness as used in context of vascular grafts meant having outer surface insufficiently smooth to enable intraluminal delivery.,Functional definition of smoothness in patents for coronary stents would not render smooth surface limitation superfluous despite another limitation of claim requiring that vascular graft had first diameter which permits intraluminal delivery of the tubular member into a body passageway having a lumen since first diameter limitation related to diameter of graft in its compressed form i.e. sufficiently small to permit intraluminal delivery not to its smoothness.,Jury reasonably could conclude that thickness of metal struts was proper measure of thickness of stent wall where construction of claims of patents for coronary stents did not specify how person of ordinary skill in art would have determined wall thickness and experts testified that measuring metal struts provided correct measurement of wall thickness.,Statements during reexamination that were best understood to mean that intentional deformation of metal strands in prior art sleeve resulted in certain portions of wall of sleeve being much thicker than other portions as measured from point along center line of sleeve i.e. sleeves longitudinal axis did not require that measurement of thickness include not only metal of U-loops but also space underneath U-loops and thus statements did not constitute clear and unequivocal disclaimer of scope of claims in patents for coronary stents statements reflected view that thickness of stent wall was function of thickness of metal segments making up wall.,Evidence of other patents and claims offered to distinguish structure of patented claim from structure disclosed in prior art patent could be excluded out of concern that it would confuse jury where it did not focus on obviousness which was only asserted claim in trial. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 403 28 U.S.C.A.,Court could exclude evidence proffered by competitor regarding properties of accused device due to its limited probative value in determining obviousness of claim. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 403 28 U.S.C.A.,The provision that allows a patentee to add claims in a reexamination proceeding does not require the patent owner to include an express statement that the new claims distinguish the prior art or remarks indicating how the new claims distinguish the prior art references. 35 U.S.C.A.  305 37 C.F.R.  1.552b.,A patentee may add claims in a reexamination proceeding that 1 distinguish the invention from the prior art and 2 that are added in response to an office action adverse to the patentability of a claim however claims added under either clause must satisfy the substantive limitation which prevents patent owners from adding new claims that enlarge the scope of the patents coverage. 35 U.S.C.A.  305.,US Patent 3657744.

Plaintiffs appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals held that  1 district court was entitled to make findings of fact based on the parties affidavits when ruling on the motion to dismiss and  2 action was properly dismissed for forum non conveniens.  Affirmed. ,When ruling on a motion to dismiss complaint for forum non conveniens district court was entitled to make findings of fact based on the parties affidavits.,Fact that plaintiffs in civil action were foreign nationals was relevant in assessing relative convenience in connection with a motion to dismiss their complaint for forum non conveniens.,Forum selection clause in shareholder agreement signed by predecessor-in-interest to corporation named as defendant in action for international bank fraud applied only to contract and tort claims arising under that agreement and did not establish that New York was a convenient forum for corporation or other defendants in the fraud action.,Foreign nationals who brought action against corporation and various individuals for allegedly participating in an international bank fraud that led to the failure of large banks in Argentina and Uruguay failed to allege a bona fide connection to the defendants home forum of New York so as to warrant substantial deference to their choice of forum when evaluating a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens since the vast majority of the activities alleged in the complaint were committed by foreign nationals on foreign soil.,Courts of Uruguay were an adequate and available alternative forum for purposes of evaluating a motion to dismiss foreign nationals complaint against corporation and various individuals who allegedly participated in an international bank fraud that led to the failure of large banks in Argentina and Uruguay for forum non conveniens since defendants had consented to jurisdiction in Uruguay courts those courts had exercised subject matter jurisdiction over the matter and evidence was presented that they were not biased.,Private and public interests supported dismissal of foreign nationals complaint against corporation and various individuals who allegedly participated in an international bank fraud that led to the failure of large banks in Argentina and Uruguay for forum non conveniens where nearly all of the relevant non-party witnesses were in Argentina and Uruguay and the resolution of the case would require extensive applications of both Uruguayan and Argentine law.

The United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia Clay D. Land J. 2013 WL 5755585 granted summary judgment for defendant. Mortgagor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Jane A. Restani United States Court of International Trade Judge sitting by designation held that  1 regulations issued by Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD that were clearly referenced in deed as conditions precedent to power to accelerate and power of sale could form basis of breach of contract action under Georgia law against mortgagees successor in interest  2 pre-existing duty rule did not apply  3 causation and damages were lacking on breach of contract claim  4 any visits by agents of mortgagees successor in interest to mortgaged property were permitted by contract and thus no action for trespass could lie  5 successor did not knowingly make false statement and  6 successors explanation satisfied its obligations under RESPA.  Affirmed on other grounds. ,The elements for a breach of contract claim in Georgia are the 1 breach and the 2 resultant damages 3 to the party who has the right to complain about the contract being broken.,Regulations issued by Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD that were clearly referenced in deed as conditions precedent to power to accelerate and power of sale could form basis of breach of contract action under Georgia law against mortgagees successor in interest after unauthorized acceleration of note as predicted by a federal court.

Restatement Second of Contracts  73 comment.,Causation and damages were lacking on breach of contract claim under Georgia law against mortgagees successor in interest for unauthorized acceleration of note without complying with regulations issued by Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD that were clearly referenced in deed as conditions precedent to power to accelerate and power of sale exercise of power to accelerate note could not have caused harm to mortgagor because there had not been actual exercise of power of sale and mortgagor could simply pay all outstanding monthly payments and associated fees admittedly owed under generous reinstatement provision contained in deed.,Any visits by agents of mortgagees successor in interest to mortgaged property were permitted by contract and thus no action for trespass could lie under Georgia law where deed allowed lender to inspect the Property if the Property is vacant or abandoned or the loan is in default and mortgagor admittedly was in default.,Georgia law recognizes that the common law right to the exclusive use and possession of property may be modified by agreement in which the landowner grants permission to enter his property under certain circumstances.,Mortgagees successor in interest did not knowingly make false statement by publishing information about its intent to sell the mortgaged property and thus attempted wrongful foreclosure claim under Georgia law was not viable since successor believed that it was entitled to foreclose on the property at the time and statement was not statement of debtors financial condition but rather statement of successors future actions.,Under Georgia law to recover damages for a wrongful attempted foreclosure the plaintiff must prove a knowing and intentional publication of untrue and derogatory information concerning the debtors financial condition and that damages were sustained as a direct result of this publication.,Explanation by mortgagees successor in interest that it had returned funds from mortgagors payments because they were not certified funds and were inadequate to cure default based on research by successor provided the borrower with a written explanation of the reasons for which the servicer believes the account of the borrower is correct and thus satisfied successors obligations under Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA.

../../files/WestLaw/JPMorgan Chase/085 - Ross v Bank of America NA(USA).txt, Background Credit cardholders brought putative class antitrust action against credit card issuing banks alleging that banks illegally colluded to force cardholders to accept mandatory arbitration clauses. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York William H. Pauley III J. 2006 WL 2685082 dismissed complaint. Cardholders appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals B.D. Parker Jr. Circuit Judge held that cardholders complaint sufficiently alleged injury in fact as required for Article 3 standing.  Vacated and remanded. ,Standing is the threshold question in every federal case determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.,To establish constitutional standing under Article 3 a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact that is distinct and palpable the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action and the injury must be likely redressable by a favorable decision. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Injury in fact as required for standing is a low threshold.,The burden rests on the party asserting jurisdiction to clearly allege facts demonstrating standing.,Besides demonstrating Article 3 standing an antitrust plaintiff must also establish antitrust standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,To demonstrate antitrust standing a plaintiff first must show that he suffered an antitrust injury which is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.,In deciding whether antitrust standing exists a court in addition to considering whether the plaintiff suffered an antitrust injury must also consider other factors relevant to standing including 1 the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury 2 the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement 3 the speculativeness of the alleged injury and 4 the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.,A court proceeds to an antitrust standing analysis only after Article 3 standing has been established. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Dismissals of claims for lack of standing are reviewed de novo.,Credit cardholders complaint stating that as result of issuing banks illegal conspiracy and group boycott they were subjected to suppressed competition and deprived of meaningful choice on critical term and condition of their general purpose card accounts sufficiently alleged injury in fact as required for cardholders to have Article 3 standing in Sherman Act action to challenge mandatory arbitration clauses in credit card contracts. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,Antitrust standing demands a much more detailed and focused inquiry into a plaintiffs antitrust claims than constitutional standing.,There is no heightened standard for pleading an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article 3 standing simply because the alleged injury is caused by an antitrust violation.,Credit cardholders action alleging that issuing banks violated Sherman Act by subjecting them to mandatory arbitration were ripe for review in that alleged injuries including being subjected to suppressed competition and deprived of meaningful choice on critical term and condition of general purpose card accounts were actual and imminent not merely speculative or hypothetical. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,The requirement that a dispute must be ripe prevents a federal court from entangling itself in abstract disagreements over matters that are premature for review because the injury is merely speculative and may never occur.,Ripeness overlaps in some respects with standing most notably in the shared requirement that the plaintiffs injury be imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical.,Court of Appeals would not defer review under doctrine of prudential ripeness of credit cardholders claims that issuing banks violated Sherman Act by subjecting them to contracts requiring mandatory arbitration inasmuch as injuries alleged by cardholders were present ongoing harms that continued to affect credit market as long as consumer choice and quality of credit services offered were artificially suppressed. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.

../../files/WestLaw/JPMorgan Chase/133 - Companion Health Services Inc v Kurtz.txt, Background Company authorized to license space within certain retail stores brought action against licensee defendants alleging various breach of contract and related tort claims and requesting to pierce the corporate veil to impose liability on the two principals of all the licensee companies. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts George A. OToole J. entered default judgment on the veil piercing claim and following a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff denied plaintiffs motion to amend the judgment to include prejudgment interest. The two principals appealed and plaintiff cross-appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Stahl Circuit Judge held that sanction of default on veil piercing claim was not appropriate.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,A court of appeals reviews for abuse of discretion a district courts imposition of default as a sanction for discovery violations and reviews the factual findings upon which the sanction is based for clear error. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,In reviewing for abuse of discretion the imposition of sanctions for discovery violations a court of appeals is not concerned with whether it would have itself imposed the particular sanction chosen by the district court and instead typically defers to the district court as the trial judge is usually the person most familiar with the circumstances of the case and is in the best position to evaluate the good faith and credibility of the parties. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,The party challenging the imposition of a default judgment as a sanction for discovery violations bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the trial judge was clearly not justified in entering an order of default. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,In evaluating under the abuse of discretion standard the appropriateness of a sanction for discovery violations a court of appeals need not examine evidence in the record beyond that considered by the district court when it imposed the sanction. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,While a court of appeals gives deference to a district court in reviewing the imposition of sanctions for discovery violations it will not rubber-stamp the imposition of a sanction. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,While default judgment is considered a drastic sanction for discovery violations its entry provides a useful remedy when a litigant is confronted by an obstructionist adversary and plays a constructive role in maintaining the orderly and efficient administration of justice as this remedy is contrary to the goals of resolving cases on the merits and avoiding harsh or unfair results the district court in its superior on-the-ground position must balance these competing considerations before entering default. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,A district court need not consider or try lesser sanctions before imposing default for discovery violations but a failure to do so can contribute to a finding that the district court abused its discretion. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,The goal of a sanction for discovery violations is both to penalize wrongful conduct and to deter future similar conduct by the particular party and others who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,Sanction of default was not appropriate on veil piercing count of licensors claim against licensees principals stemming from breach of contract dispute based on principals failure to respond to deadline for submitting responses to interrogatories and document requests which was issued nine days earlier during which time the principals were unrepresented by counsel though there was perhaps enough litigation misconduct by the principals for a default sanction if the totality of their behavior during the entire history of the case had been considered the district court based the sanction on a single instance for which there were significant and legitimate mitigating excuses and did not make sufficient factual findings to support its ultimate sanction. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,A severe sanction for discovery violations such as default or dismissal is inappropriate in most cases when based on one incident. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 37 28 U.S.C.A.,A motion for relief from judgment based on a clerical mistake or an oversight or omission may only be granted where the judgment failed to reflect the courts intention. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 60a 28 U.S.C.A.,A post-judgment motion made within ten days of the entry of judgment that questions the correctness of a judgment is properly construed as a motion to alter or amend judgment.

Affirmed. ,Court of Appeals reviews de novo a district courts application of preemption principles.,Consumers state common law claims against bank for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by purported willful and malicious furnishing of false information about his finances to consumer credit reporting agency were preempted by FCRA providing that no requirement or prohibition could be imposed under laws of any state with respect to any subject matter regulated under provision relating to responsibilities of persons furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies since FCRA preempted both state statutes and state common law actions. Fair Credit Reporting Act  625b1F 15 U.S.C.A.  1681tb1F.,Under FCRAs preemption provision stating that no requirement or prohibition may be imposed under laws of any state with respect to subject matter regulated by the FCRA the phrase no requirement or prohibition sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law to the contrary those words easily encompass obligations that take the form of common-law rules. Fair Credit Reporting Act  625b1F 15 U.S.C.A.  1681tb1F.,FCRA provision prohibiting consumer from bringing any action in the nature of defamation invasion of privacy or negligence with respect to reporting of information against any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure consumer preempts some state claims that could arise out of reports to credit agencies and FCRAs later-enacted broad preemption provision stating that no requirement or prohibition may be imposed under laws of any state with respect to subject matter regulated by the FCRA simply preempts more of these claims including claims involving false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure consumer.

P. 59e.,Where the plaintiff sought through a motion to alter or amend judgment leave to amend his complaint and the District Court denied the motion on the basis that the amendment would be futile the Court of Appeals to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying the motion to alter or amend judgment must ask whether the proposed complaint indeed failed to state a claim for relief.

Holdings The Court of Appeals Pooler Circuit Judge held that  1 Tax Injunction Act did not apply to preclude district court consideration of preemption claim  2 UBTI tax was not preempted as having impermissible connection with ERISA plan and  3 UBTI tax did not have impermissible reference to ERISA plan so as to be preempted.  Affirmed. ,To invoke Tax Injunction Act which prohibits district court from restraining collection of state tax the surcharges must constitute taxes and the state remedies available to plaintiffs must be plain speedy and efficient. 28 U.S.C.A.  1341.,Tax Injunction Act TIA did not bar claim of pension plan fiduciary that states collection of unrelated business taxable income UBTI was preempted by ERISA inasmuch as federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over actions determining ERISA preemption of state taxes there was no plain speedy and efficient remedy in state court to redress claim as required to apply TIA.

Holding The Court of Appeals Dennis Jacobs Chief Judge held that securities laws implicitly precluded antitrust liability.  Affirmed. ,A complaint pleading a violation of the section of the Sherman Act declaring trusts in restraint of trade illegal must allege a contract combination or conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,The analysis for determining whether securities law implicitly precludes application of antitrust law turns on four considerations whether the area of conduct is squarely within the heartland of securities regulations whether the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has clear and adequate authority to regulate whether there is active and ongoing agency regulation and whether a serious conflict arises between antitrust law and securities regulations.,Whether there is a serious conflict between antitrust law and securities regulations which is the fourth consideration for determining whether securities law implicitly precludes application of antitrust law is evaluated at the level of the alleged anticompetitive conduct each of the three remaining considerations whether the area of conduct is squarely within the heartland of securities regulations whether the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has clear and adequate authority to regulate and whether there is active and ongoing agency regulation is evaluated at the level most useful to the court in achieving overarching goal of avoiding conflict between securities and antitrust regimes.,Short selling was within the heartland of the securities business and thus consideration of whether the area of conduct at issue fell squarely within the heartland of securities regulation as a factor for determining whether securities law implicitly precluded application of antitrust law weighed in favor of finding that short sellers anti-trust claim alleging that prime brokers charged artificially inflated borrowing fees by arbitrarily designating certain securities as hard-to-borrow and then fixing the price for borrowing them was impliedly precluded by securities law.,Securities and Exchange Commission SEC had authority under the Securities Exchange Act to regulate the role of prime brokers in short selling as well as the borrowing fees charged by the brokers and thus consideration of whether SEC had clear and adequate authority to regulate as a factor for determining whether securities law implicitly precluded application of antitrust law weighed in favor of finding that short sellers antitrust claim alleging that prime brokers charged artificially inflated borrowing fees by arbitrarily designating certain securities as hard-to-borrow and then fixing the price for borrowing them was impliedly precluded. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  6e1B 10a1 b 15c2D 15 U.S.C.A.  78fe1B 78ja1 b 78oc2D.,Securities and Exchange Commission SEC engaged in ongoing regulation of role of prime brokers in short selling and thus consideration of whether there was active and ongoing agency regulation as a factor for determining whether securities law implicitly precluded application of antitrust law weighed in favor of finding that short sellers antitrust claim alleging prime brokers charged artificially inflated borrowing fees by arbitrarily designating certain securities as hard-to-borrow and then fixing the price for borrowing them was impliedly precluded SEC adopted regulation imposing locate and delivery requirements on brokers and it hosted roundtable regarding securities lending and short sales. 17 C.F.R.  242.203b1iiii b3.,Allowing antitrust liability in context of short sellers claim alleging prime brokers charged artificially inflated borrowing fees by arbitrarily designating certain securities as hard-to-borrow and then fixing the price for borrowing them would have created actual and potential conflicts with securities regime and thus conflict factor as a consideration for assessing whether securities law implicitly precluded application of antitrust law weighed in favor of finding sellers claim precluded antitrust liability would have created incentive for brokers to curb permissible exchange of information and thereby harmed efficient functioning of market and there was possibility SEC would have acted in future on its authority to regulate brokers fees. 17 C.F.R.  242.203b1.,Communications between brokers about the availability and price of securities are implicitly permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commissions SECs regulation requiring that a broker borrow securities or have reasonable grounds to believe that the securities can be borrowed before accepting an order from a short seller. 17 C.F.R.  242.203b1.,Conflict between antitrust law and securities law as a factor for determining whether securities law implicitly precludes application of antitrust law is a risk unless there is a practical way to confine antitrust suits so that they challenge only activity of the kind the plaintiffs seek to target without inhibiting other conduct that is permitted or encouraged under the securities law.

Truth in Lending Act  102 15 U.S.C.A.  1601.,A court must construe TILAs provisions liberally in favor of the consumer and require absolute compliance by creditors. Truth in Lending Act  102 15 U.S.C.A.  1601.,Courts must defer to the decisions of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to TILAs disclosure requirements and cannot apply the concept of meaningful disclosure that animates TILA in the abstract.

Truth in Lending Act  102 105a 15 U.S.C.A.  1601 1604a 12 C.F.R.  226.2a20 226.5c.,TILA is only a disclosure statute and does not substantively regulate consumer credit but rather requires disclosure of certain terms and conditions of credit before consummation of a consumer credit transaction. Truth in Lending Act  102 15 U.S.C.A.  1601.,While a creditors inaccurate disclosure that itself breaches a credit agreement may also violate TILA the breach of a credit agreement based on conduct independent of the disclosures does not necessarily give rise to a TILA claim. Truth in Lending Act  102 15 U.S.C.A.  1601.,When neither Congress nor the Federal Reserve Board has elected to require a particular disclosure under TILA such as a disclosure about a creditors intent a court should not impose that disclosure requirement. Truth in Lending Act  102 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1601 et seq.,A creditors undisclosed intent to act inconsistent with its disclosures regarding an open-ended credit agreement is irrelevant in determining the sufficiency of those disclosures under TILA.

Bankr.Code 11 U.S.C.A.  304b1.,United States courts may resolve bona fide questions of property ownership arising under local law while a foreign bankruptcy proceeding is ongoing without deferring to the parallel foreign proceeding on grounds of international comity.,Court would abstain on grounds of international comity from assuming jurisdiction over proceedings brought by lending bank against foreign borrower seeking a judgment declaring that certain funds held in a collection account in the bank belonged to it the funds in the collection account never belonged to the bank but rather the funds were mistakenly paid by the debtor via three of its customers from whom debtor assigned its right to payment as collateral on the debt as partial payment on the debt after the debtor had already filed for suspension of payments in Mexico.,A federal court defers to foreign bankruptcy proceedings on international comity grounds only if those proceedings do not violate the laws or public policy of the United States and abide by fundamental standards of procedural fairness.,Arguments not made in an appellants opening brief are waived even if the appellant pursued those arguments in the district court or raised them in a reply brief.,In proceedings brought by lending bank against foreign borrower seeking a judgment declaring that certain funds held in a collection account in the bank belonged to it no manifest injustice would result in refusing to allow lending bank to claim that a six-year delay in the Mexican bankruptcy court was procedurally unfair and that the United States court should therefore decline to extend comity to such proceedings where the delay in the solution of the bankruptcy proceedings was due in substantial part to banks decision to appeal the Mexican courts determination that consortium members were general unsecured creditors.,Regardless of parties pre-litigation agreement once a party declares bankruptcy in a foreign state and a foreign court asserts jurisdiction over the distribution of assets United States courts may defer to the foreign bankruptcy proceeding on international comity grounds.

Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Lawrence M. McKenna J. 2005 WL 2087811 initially denied motion and adhered to such decision on reconsideration 2005 WL 2667201. Defendants appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Jos A. Cabranes Circuit Judge held that  1 advisor lacked Article III standing to bring suit  2 advisors relationship with clients did not confer prudential exception to injury in fact requirement for Article III standing and  3 advisors alleged injuries did not satisfy injury-in-fact requirement in order to confer Article III standing.  Reversed and remanded. ,Court of appeals reviews de novo whether a plaintiff has constitutional standing to sue. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Because standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings the court of appeals accepts as true all material allegations of the complaint and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.,Article III standing consists of three irreducible elements 1 injury-in-fact which is a concrete and particularized harm to a legally protected interest 2 causation in the form of a fairly traceable connection between the asserted injury-in-fact and the alleged actions of the defendant and 3 redressability or a non-speculative likelihood that the injury can be remedied by the requested relief. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,As a general rule the injury-in-fact requirement for Article III standing means that a plaintiff must have personally suffered an injury. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Courts may permit a party with standing to assign its claims to a third party who will stand in the place of the injured party and satisfy the constitutional requirement of an injury-in-fact. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Grant of a power of attorney is not the equivalent of an assignment of ownership and standing alone does not enable the grantee to bring suit in his own name.,Minimum requirement for constitutional standing requirement of injury-in-fact is that the plaintiff have legal title to or a proprietary interest in the claim. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,An assignment of claims transfers legal title or ownership of those claims and thus fulfills the constitutional standing requirement of an injury-in-fact. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Financial advisors power of attorney did not confer ownership interest in clients federal securities claims as required for advisor to have Article III standing to pursue claims on behalf of clients advisors only interest in the litigation as attorney-in-fact was recovery of its legal fees which were byproduct of suit itself and could not serve as basis for Article III standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Recovery of legal fees which are a byproduct of a suit itself cannot serve as a basis for Article III standing. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Prudential exceptions to Article III standing injury in fact requirement permit third-party standing where the plaintiff can demonstrate 1 a close relationship to the injured party and 2 a barrier to the injured partys ability to assert its own interests. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  1 et seq.,Investment advisors relationship with clients upon whose behalf advisor brought suit for violations of federal securities laws did not confer prudential exception to injury in fact requirement for Article III standing absent demonstration that there was a hindrance to clients ability to protect their own interests.

../../files/WestLaw/JPMorgan Chase/191 - Hawks v JP Morgan Chase Bank.txt, Background Male employee brought action in state court against his former employer for violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act MHRA alleging that employer discriminated against him on the basis of gender and created a hostile work environment. Employer removed the action and moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri Dean Whipple J. granted employers motion to dismiss and denied employees motion to set aside or reconsider the order of dismissal. Employee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Smith Circuit Judge held that  1 employee was not entitled to an extension of time to respond to motion to dismiss  2 employee failed to allege that he was treated differently from similarly-situated female employees as required to state gender discrimination claim and  3 District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying employees motion for reconsideration.  Affirmed. ,Involvement of employees counsel in two bench trials and a hearing did not constitute excusable neglect that would warrant granting employees motion for extension of time to respond to former employers motion to dismiss employees discrimination suit. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 6b1B 28 U.S.C.A.,A district court is authorized to exercise its discretion to permit a motion for substitution beyond the time originally prescribed when the failure to file the motion was the result of excusable neglect. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 6b 28 U.S.C.A.,The determination as to what sort of neglect is considered excusable so as to warrant granting a motion for an extension of time is an equitable one taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the partys own omission. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 6b1B 28 U.S.C.A.,Male employee failed to allege that he was treated differently from similarly situated female employees as required to state gender discrimination claim against his former employer under the Missouri Human Rights Act MHRA. V.A.M.S.  213.055.,For a plaintiff to prove that he was discharged based on his gender he must first set forth a prima facie case of sex discrimination.,The elements of a prima facie case of sex discrimination are 1 the employee belonged to a protected class 2 he was qualified to perform his job 3 he suffered an adverse employment action and 4 he was treated differently from similarly situated females the fourth element also can be met if the employee provides some other evidence that would give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.,Once a prima facie case of employment discrimination is established the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for his action then if the employer is able to set forth such a rationale the complaining party must demonstrate that the employers stated reason is in actuality a pretext for discrimination.,An inference of employment discrimination may sometimes arise without additional evidence where the overall strength of the prima facie case and the evidence of pretext suffices to show intentional discrimination.,District court did not abuse its discretion in denying employees motion to set aside or reconsider order dismissing employees complaint against former employer for failure to state a claim motion which requested that the court allow employee to amend his pleading was not filed until nearly a month after court entered its judgment of dismissal and employee had not requested leave to amend prior to dismissal.

Following a bench trial the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana 2013 WL 2181036 Richard T. Haik J. entered judgment in favor of management firm. Vessel owners appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Priscilla R. Owen Circuit Judge held that  1 management firm did not possess maritime liens  2 liquidated damages provision was penal  3 management firm wrongly arrested vessels  4 owners were not entitled to lost profits and  5 owners executed personal guarantees.  Affirmed. ,The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.,Management agreements between vessel owners and management firm were not the functional equivalent of bareboat charters and thus did not create maritime liens in favor of management firm following their breach notwithstanding that management firm had full possession and control of the vessels carried insurance and used its own crews where management firm did not pay for the vessels expenses did not owe the owners periodic payments and services performed aboard ship were for owners benefit.,Maritime liens are stricti juris and will not be extended by construction analogy or inference.,To determine the validity of a maritime lien courts must normally refer to statutory law or those liens that have been historically recognized in maritime law.,Whether a liquidated damage provision constitutes a penalty is a question of law reviewable de novo.,The party seeking to invalidate the liquidated-damage provision has the burden of proving that it is a penalty.,Liquidated damages provision in management agreements between vessel owners and management firm for four vessels was penal and thus unenforceable where calculation in provision failed to account for days that vessels would not be used provision failed to account for the reduced operating expenses for the vessels following termination of agreements and breach of one agreement regarding one vessel constituted breach of agreements for the other three.,A district courts damages award is a finding of fact which the Court of Appeals reviews for clear error if the award of damages is plausible in light of the record a reviewing court should not reverse the award even if it might have come to a different conclusion.,Damages award of 3000 per month per vessel for duration of management agreement between vessel owners and management firm was reasonable following owners alleged breach of the agreement award was plausible in light of record which indicated that management fees had consistently been higher than the minimum amount.,To recover for wrongful arrest of a vessel there must be 1 no bona fide claim of a maritime lien on the vessel and 2 a showing of bad faith malice or gross negligence on the part of the offending party.,A finding of joint venture precluding a maritime lien is reviewed by the Court of Appeals for clear error.,The district courts determination of bad faith as element of determining whether a vessel has been wrongfully arrested is a conclusion of fact which the Court of Appeals reviews under the deferential clear error standard.,The advice of competent counsel honestly sought and acted upon in good faith is alone a complete defense to a claim of damages for wrongful arrest.,Vessel management firm wrongly arrested four vessels owned by owners where firm owed money to owners at time of arrest firm did not possess maritime liens on vessels and firm acted in bad faith since it knew that it owed money to owners at the time of arrest.,Determinations of the trial court concerning the amount of damages are factual findings and the Court of Appeals will set them aside only if clearly erroneous.,A court may only award damages for detention of a vessel when profits have actually been or may be reasonably supposed to have been lost and the amount of such profits is proven with reasonable certainty.,Vessel owners failed to demonstrate lost profits due to arrest of vessels with reasonable certainty and thus were not entitled to recover them from management firm that arrest the vessels owners failed to provide information as to when vessels were returned to work or the frequency and type of work engaged in.,Assuming availability of lost-equity damages vessel owners were not entitled to recover them following vessel management firms arrest of vessels where owners failed to demonstrate that the arrest caused them to lose the vessels and file for bankruptcy.,The district courts interpretation of a contract is reviewed de novo by the Court of Appeals and the contract and record are reviewed independently and under the same standards that guided the district court.,If the interpretation of the contract turns on the consideration of extrinsic evidence such as evidence of the intent of the parties the Court of Appeals reviews for clear error.,Under Louisiana law a guaranty must be expressed clearly and must be construed within the limits intended by the parties to the agreement.,Under Louisiana law contracts of guaranty are subject to the same rules of interpretation as contracts in general accordingly courts are bound to give legal effect to all such contracts according to the true intent of the parties and this intent is to be determined by the words of the contract when these are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences.,Under Louisiana law vessel owners unambiguously executed personal guarantees for vessels in agreements with vessel management firm and thus were personally liable for early termination of agreements with management firm notwithstanding that limited liability company created by owners was listed as principal of limited liability companies that owned vessels owners signatures appeared on guarantee indicating that they signed in their personal capacities.,Neither vessel owner nor vessel management firm were entitled to prejudgment interest on firms claim for breach of management agreements that damages awarded by the court were significantly less than those sought by the parties constituted peculiar circumstances.,As a general rule prejudgment interest should be awarded in admiralty cases not as a penalty but as compensation for the use of funds to which the claimant was rightfully entitled.,The district court has discretion to deny prejudgment interest on an admiralty claim only when there are peculiar circumstances that would make it inequitable for the losing party to be forced to pay prejudgment interest such circumstances may be found where plaintiff improperly delayed resolution of the action where a genuine dispute over a good faith claim exists in a mutual fault setting where some equitable doctrine cautions against the award or where the damages award was substantially less than the amount claimed by plaintiff.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Cote J. 867 F.Supp.2d 389 granted judgment for respondents. Petitioners appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Hall Circuit Judge held that  1 on matter of first impression an electronic fund transfer EFT blocked midstream is property of a foreign state or the property of an agency or instrumentality of such a state subject to attachment under the FSIA only where either the state itself or an agency or instrumentality thereof such as a state-owned financial institution transmitted the EFT directly to the bank where the EFT is held pursuant to the block  2 remand was required for parties to conduct discovery and  3 Presidential waiver effectively rendered FSIA attachment remedy unavailable.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,An electronic fund transfer EFT blocked midstream is property of a foreign state or the property of an agency or instrumentality of such a state subject to attachment under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act only where either the state itself or an agency or instrumentality thereof such as a state-owned financial institution transmitted the EFT directly to the bank where the EFT is held pursuant to the block. 28 U.S.C.A.  1610g.,De novo review applied to issue of whether electronic fund transfers EFTs blocked in United States banks pursuant to sanctions regimes imposed upon North Korea by United States government were property of North Korea or the property of an agency or instrumentality of North Korea and thus whether attachment of the EFTs under Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was possible. 28 U.S.C.A.  1610g.,Whether midstream electronic fund transfers EFTs may be attached or seized depends upon the nature and wording of the statute pursuant to which attachment and seizure is sought.,When Congress has not created any new property rights but merely attaches consequences federally defined to rights created under state law a federal court applying federal law must look to state law to define the rights the judgment debtor has in the property the creditor seeks to reach.,Congress provided under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that property of a foreign state is subject to execution and absent any indication that Congress intended a special definition of the term property interests are ordinarily those created and defined by state law. 28 U.S.C.A.  1610g.,Under the New York Uniform Commercial Code UCC the only entity with a property interest in an electronic fund transfer EFT while it is midstream is the entity immediately preceding the bank holding the EFT in the transaction chain in the context of a blocked transaction this means that the only entity with a property interest in the stopped EFT is the entity that passed the EFT on to the bank where it presently rests. N.Y.McKinneys Uniform Commercial Code  4A502d 4A503.,Record contained little to no evidence of whether entities that transmitted electronic fund transfers EFTs to respondent banks were agencies or instrumentalities of North Korea and thus remand was required for parties to conduct discovery aimed at resolving those factual issues in proceeding to satisfy judgment entered pursuant to Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act FSIA against Democratic Republic of North Korea and its main intelligence agency since determination could not be made as to whether EFTs were properly attachable without knowing nature of those entities. 28 U.S.C.A.  1610g.,Presidential waiver by valid executive order of provision for any property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated under the Trading with the Enemy Act TWEA or International Emergency Economic Powers Act IEEPA to be subject to execution or attachment to satisfy judgment which was obtained under terrorism exception outlined in Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act FSIA effectively rendered that attachment remedy unavailable to families and victims of terrorist attack in Israel against Democratic Republic of North Korea and its main intelligence agency. 28 U.S.C.A.  1610f1.

../../files/WestLaw/JPMorgan Chase/22 - In re Lehman Bros Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation.txt, Background Investors brought putative class actions to hold credit ratings agencies liable under Securities Act as underwriters or control persons for misstatements or omissions in securities offering documents for mortgage pass-through certificates. After actions were removed and consolidated the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Lewis A. Kaplan J. 681 F.Supp.2d 495 dismissed and investors appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Reena Raggi Circuit Judge held that  1 ratings agencies were not underwriters under Securities Act and  2 ratings agencies were not subject to control person liability under Securities Act.  Affirmed. ,Credit ratings agencies that participated in structuring of mortgage pass-through certificates were not underwriters under Securities Act even if agencies models calculated amount of credit enhancement required for specific pool of loans to receive desired rating which was necessary predicate to securities distribution to institutional investors and agencies reviewed and commented on draft prospectus supplements incorporated into registration statements where agencies were not involved in actual distribution of securities. Securities Act of 1933  2a11 15 U.S.C.A.  77ba11.,To interpret statute court must begin with statutes text considering ordinary meaning of Congresss chosen language as informed by its punctuation.,To qualify as underwriter under Securities Act person must participate directly or indirectly in purchasing securities from issuer with view to distribution in offering or selling securities for issuer in connection with distribution or in underwriting of such offering. Securities Act of 1933  2a11 15 U.S.C.A.  77ba11.,Securities laws are interpreted expansively to effectuate their remedial purposes.,In interpreting statute ultimate question is one of congressional intent not one of whether court can improve law.,Structuring or creating securities does not constitute requisite participation in underwriting to warrant imposition of strict liability under Securities Act. Securities Act of 1933  2a11 15 U.S.C.A.  77ba11.,For purposes of Securities Act control person provision control means power to direct or cause direction of primary violators management and policies whether through ownership of voting securities by contract or otherwise. Securities Act of 1933  15a 15 U.S.C.A.  77o a.,Credit ratings agencies that provided advice and strategic direction in structuring of mortgage pass-through certificates issued by investment banks lacked sufficient power to direct banks management and policies to subject them to control person liability under Securities Act where banks were free to pressure agencies by awarding business to agency providing highest percentage of AAA ratings with lowest levels of credit enhancement.

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Jones J. 2010 WL 430771 granted defendants motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Hall Circuit Judge held that  1 plaintiffs pled only parallel conduct on part of defendants with no common motive to conspire and  2 plaintiffs failed to allege high level of interfirm communications.  Affirmed on other grounds. ,Court of Appeals reviews de novo a district courts dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,When reviewing a district courts dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim the Court of Appeals accepts all factual allegations as true and draw every reasonable inference from those facts in the plaintiffs favor. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,While a complaint attacked by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim does not need detailed factual allegations the plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim a complaint must provide enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face this standard does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage but rather calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal conduct. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Crucial question in a case under the Sherman Act provision banning conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States is whether the challenged conduct stems from an independent decision or from an agreement tacit or express. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Ultimate existence of an agreement under antitrust law banning conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States is a legal conclusion not a factual allegation. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Plaintiffs job at the pleading stage of a claim under the Sherman Act provision banning conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States in order to overcome a motion to dismiss is to allege enough facts to support the inference that a conspiracy actually existed. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,In absence of smoking gun proving the existence of an antitrust conspiracy the complaint may in order to survive a motion to dismiss present circumstantial facts supporting the inference of a conspiracy such as the existence of a horizontal agreement based on conscious parallelism when such interdependent conduct is accompanied by circumstantial evidence and plus factors including a common motive to conspire evidence that shows that the parallel acts were against the apparent individual economic selfinterest of the alleged conspirators and evidence of a high level of interfirm communications. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On a claim for antitrust conspiracy a bare allegation of parallel conduct is not enough to survive a motion to dismiss. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Even if a plaintiff alleges not only parallel conduct but also additional facts or circumstances in support of an antitrust conspiracy claim those facts or circumstances must still lead to an inference of conspiracy. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Citys mayor and council pled only parallel conduct on part of banks and various other financial institutions with no common motive to conspire in relation to withdrawal from auction rate securities market which then purportedly triggered collapse of market for such securities as required to support putative class claim for antitrust conspiracy although defendants withdrew from market in a virtually simultaneous manner plaintiffs allegations were consistent with finding that market was already collapsing when defendants withdrew so that defendants acted rationally and in anticipation of similar actions taken by competitors. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Citys mayor and council failed to allege sufficient specific communications between banks and various other financial institutions to warrant finding of high level of interfirm communications as required to support antitrust conspiracy claim related to defendants withdrawal from auction rate securities market which then purportedly triggered collapse of market for such securities many communications were internal to individual defendants and only communications that tended to assert something more than conscious parallelism were two vague references to isolated discussions among only three defendants.

Credit Repair Organizations Act  4033A 15 U.S.C.A.  1679a3A.,Court of Appeals treads carefully when determining whether it is appropriate to put aside the basic tenet of corporate law that corporations notwithstanding relationships between or among them ordinarily are regarded as separate and distinct entities and thereby to allow a plaintiff to pierce the corporate veil of limited liability.,In Massachusetts the corporate veil will only be pierced in rare situations.,Under Massachusetts law factors relevant to corporate veil-piercing analysis are 1 common ownership 2 pervasive control 3 confused intermingling of business assets 4 thin capitalization 5 nonobservance of corporate formalities 6 absence of corporate records 7 no payment of dividends 8 insolvency at the time of the litigated transaction 9 siphoning away of corporations funds by dominant shareholder 10 nonfunctioning of officers and directors 11 use of the corporation for transactions of the dominant shareholders and 12 use of the corporation in promoting fraud.,Under Massachusetts law credit counseling companies served as alter egos of companies owners and thus owners could be held personally liable for companies violations of Credit Repair Organizations Act CROA owners had pervasive control over companies which functioned without clear boundaries or separate corporate structures owners liberally commingled companies finances using funds of one to pay bills of others and owners by immediately transferring new clients accounts from one company to another misled clients as to which entity was obligated to them.

Judgment of BAP reversed and proceedings remanded. ,In an appeal from a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel BAP decision the Court of Appeals independently reviews the decision of the bankruptcy court reviewing the courts factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.,Debtor seeking confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan has three options regarding a creditors allowed secured claim 1 obtain the creditors acceptance of the plan 2 keep the collateral securing the claim and make payments equaling the present value of the claim or 3 surrender the collateral securing the claim to the creditor. 11 U.S.C.A.  1325a5.,Under the section of the Bankruptcy Code governing determination of secured status a claim secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest is separated or bifurcated into a secured portion reflecting the value of the property and an unsecured portion reflecting the remaining debt or deficiency. 11 U.S.C.A.  506a.,Under the cram down or retention option for collateral securing a creditors allowed secured claim a Chapter 13 debtor is permitted to keep the property over the objection of the creditor the creditor retains the lien securing the claim and the debtor is required to provide the creditor with payments over the life of the plan that will total the present value of the collateral. 11 U.S.C.A.  506a 1325a5B.,Under the Bankruptcy Code as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act BAPCPA a Chapter 13 debtor who keeps a 910 vehicle that serves as collateral for a creditors allowed secured claim must now pay the entire claim as filed in other words a 910 car claim is treated as fully secured. 11 U.S.C.A.  506a 1325a5B.,When a Chapter 13 debtor surrenders a 910 vehicle the hanging paragraph added to the Bankruptcy Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act BAPCPA does not abrogate the creditors right to assert an unsecured deficiency claim if authorized by the underlying contract and state law. 11 U.S.C.A.  506a 1325a5 1325a5C.,When statutory language is clear the court need not look beyond it.,There is a presumption that claims under applicable state law will be allowed in bankruptcy unless they are expressly disallowed.,In the absence of a contrary federal rule a bankruptcy court should ensure that a creditors rights are protected in accordance with state law.,Phrase allowed secured claim as used in the section of the Bankruptcy Code specifying the conditions for confirmation of a debtors Chapter 13 plan with respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan simply means a claim that is allowed under the Code and secured by a lien under state law. 11 U.S.C.A.  502 1325a5.
../../files/WestLaw/JPMorgan Chase/44 - Kansas Judicial Review v Stout.txt, Background Political action committee candidate for elective office of Kansas district court judge and prospective candidate for such office brought  1983 action asserting First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to provisions of Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct limiting campaign activity by judicial candidates. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas Julie A. Robinson J. 440 F.Supp.2d 1209 granted in part and denied in part a preliminary injunction against the provisions. Thereafter the District Court 455 F.Supp.2d 1258 denied defendants motion to certify questions and to issue a stay pending appeal. Defendants appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Carlos F. Lucero Circuit Judge held that  1 prospective candidate and political action committee had First Amendment standing  2 challenge was ripe for review and  3 novel and determinative questions of state law warranted certification of questions to Kansas Supreme Court.  Questions certified injunction vacated in part. ,Court of Appeals reviews questions of justiciability de novo.,Court of Appeals reviews de novo whether the requirements for Pullman abstention have been met.,In order to establish that standing exists a plaintiff must show 1 an injury in fact 2 a causal connection between the injury and the challenged act and 3 a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.,Prospective candidate for Kansas district court judge was a willing speaker so as to confer standing upon political action committee to bring First Amendment challenge to provisions of Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct forbidding judicial candidates from making pledges and promises forbidding them from committing as to issues likely to come before court and prohibiting them from personally soliciting publicly stated support but for the limitations imposed by the Code candidate would have answered political action committees questionnaire designed to elicit views on a variety of legal and political issues. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1 Kan.Sup.Ct.Rules Rule 601A Code of Jud.Conduct Canon 5A3i ii C2.,In First Amendment cases a plaintiff need not be subject to a speech restriction in order to have standing to advance a challenge as protections extend to both speakers and listeners the latter having a right to receive information and ideas. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Court of Appeals is obligated to conduct an independent de novo review to determine whether a case is moot before proceeding to the merits.,In order for a claim to be justiciable it must present a live controversy ripe for determination advanced in a clean-cut and concrete form.,Ripeness inquiry focuses not on whether the plaintiff was in fact harmed but rather whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.,Ripeness doctrine addresses a timing question when in time is it appropriate for a court to take up the asserted claim.,Generally federal courts apply a two-factor test to determine whether an issue is ripe they evaluate the fitness of the issue for judicial resolution and the hardship to the parties of withholding judicial consideration.,Ripeness analysis is relaxed somewhat in the context of a First Amendment facial challenge because an unconstitutional law may chill free speech. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,In First Amendment facial challenges federal courts look at three factors to evaluate the ripeness of a free speech claim 1 hardship to the parties by withholding review 2 the chilling effect the challenged law may have on First Amendment liberties and 3 fitness of the controversy for judicial review. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Judicial candidates and political action committees free speech challenge to provisions of Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct limiting campaign activity by judicial candidates in particular the candidates responses to politician action committees questionnaire were ripe for review even though no disciplinary action was pending against the candidates withholding judicial review of the provisions would have created a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties provisions had a chilling effect on candidates speech due to their alleged vagueness and overbreadth and both facial and as applied challenges to the provisions were fit for judicial review as facts of the case were relatively uncontested. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1 Kan.Sup.Ct.Rules Rule 601A Code of Jud.Conduct Canon 5A3i ii C2.,In determining whether hardship would result to parties were court to withhold judicial review of free speech challenge for purposes of determining ripeness court asks whether the provision creates a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,The arguable vagueness and the resulting chilling effect on speech of a statute greatly militates in favor of finding an otherwise premature controversy to be ripe for review. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,In considering whether issues are fit for judicial review for purposes of ripeness analysis court focuses on whether determination of the merits turns upon strictly legal issues or requires facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Pullman abstention is appropriate when 1 an uncertain issue of state law underlies the federal constitutional claim 2 the state issues are amenable to interpretation and such an interpretation obviates the need for or substantially narrows the scope of the constitutional claim and 3 an incorrect decision of state law would hinder important state law policies.,Pullman abstention is a narrow exception to the duty of federal courts to adjudicate cases properly before them and is used only in exceptional circumstances.,Certification allows a federal court faced with a novel state-law question to put the question directly to the states highest court and has the advantages of reducing the delay cutting the cost and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response from the state court.,Certification of questions from federal court to states highest court promotes cooperative judicial federalism particularly in circumstances where a state court has not yet had the opportunity to interpret the pertinent statutory language.,Certification of questions from federal court to states highest court is consistent with federal duties to avoid passing on the constitutionality of a statute where possible and in particular to avoid considering the constitutionality of a state statute in the absence of a controlling interpretation of its meaning and effect by the state courts.,Certification of question from federal court to states highest court is not to be routinely invoked whenever a federal court is presented with an unsettled question of state law.,Absent some recognized public policy or defined principle guiding the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred federal courts bear a duty to decide questions of state law when necessary to render a judgment.,Where statutory interpretation is at issue the touchstone of certification inquiry as to questions certified to a states highest court is whether the state statute is readily susceptible of an interpretation that would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge to the statute.,The decision to certify a question to a states highest court rests in the sound discretion of the federal court and a federal court may certify a state-law issue sua sponte.,Judicial candidates and political action committees free speech challenge to provisions of Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct forbidding judicial candidates from making pledges and promises forbidding them from committing as to issues likely to come before court and prohibiting them from personally soliciting publicly stated support rested on sufficiently novel and determinative questions of state law so as to warrant certification of questions by Court of Appeals to Kansas Supreme Court provisions were promulgated by the Supreme Court and thus their interpretation fell squarely within the scope of state law important state policy interests were at play and state courts resolution of such issues could substantially alter determination of the federal constitutional issues at stake. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1 K.S.A. 603201.,Content-based restrictions on protected speech that depend upon subjective impressions raise serious constitutional questions. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Striking down a statute as overbroad is strong medicine and courts should only do so as a last resort.,To be overbroad a law must cover a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech as judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Kathleen M. OMalley J. 2005 WL 2233233 granted in part and denied in part collective motion by all banks for judgment on pleadings against all sureties and insurers. Insurance company appealed separately concerning obligations under policy containing collateral security insurance endorsement.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Ralph B. Guy Jr. Circuit Judge held that  1 endorsement established surety not insurer-insured relationship  2 surety was precluded from denying liability to bank on grounds of fraudulent inducement  3 fraud could not be imputed to bank under agency principles  4 policy was not void for fraud  5 surety waived defenses  6 suretys obligation did not exceed principals obligation due to obligee bank and  7 suretys proposed amendment to counterclaims and answers would be unduly delayed prejudicial and futile.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 10c 12c 28 U.S.C.A.,When a document is referred to in the pleadings and is integral to the claims it may be considered without converting a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 10c 12c 56c 28 U.S.C.A.,Motion to dismiss for judgment on pleadings was not converted to motion for summary judgment by submission of amicus brief filed by insurance organization in another case or by consideration of documents not attached to insurance companys counterclaim where documents including indenture and estoppel letters attesting to validity of insurance policy were attached to complaint and attached to answer to counterclaims and were among referenced documents listed in policy and amicus brief was public record and was not offered to establish any disputed facts but to incorporate arguments in analogous situation. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 10c 12c 56c 28 U.S.C.A.,A district court may consider matters of public record in deciding a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 12b6 c 28 U.S.C.A.,On motion for judgment on pleadings Court of Appeals construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party accepts the well-pled factual allegations as true and determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12c 28 U.S.C.A.,On motion for judgment on pleadings Court of Appeals need not accept the plaintiffs legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences as true. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12c 28 U.S.C.A.,To state a valid claim a complaint must contain direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements under some viable legal theory. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12c 28 U.S.C.A.,Under California law surety contracts are construed using the same rules that govern the interpretation of other contracts. Wests Ann.Cal.Civ.Code  1638 1639.,Under California law surety contracts and insurance contracts are conceptually and legally distinct in that an insurer undertakes to indemnify another against loss damage or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event whereas a surety promises to answer for the debt default or miscarriage of another.,Under California law the surety relationship promising to answer for the debt default or miscarriage of another is a tripartite one a third party who is the obligee is protected not the principal although the principal pays the premium.,Under California law an insurer has no right of subrogation against its insured a surety on the other hand is entitled to reimbursement by its principal.,Under California law no particular form of agreement is required to establish a suretyship as long as the agreement establishes the intention to create a surety contract.,Under California law it is the substance of the transaction not the form that controls in determining whether a suretyship has been established.,When the criteria for suretyship are fulfilled the secondary obligor has surety status regardless of among other things the form of the transaction the terms used to describe the secondary obligor or the secondary obligation or whether the secondary obligation is conditional or unconditional.,A secondary obligor has the status of a surety when 1 pursuant to contract which is the secondary obligation an obligee has recourse against a person who is the secondary obligor with respect to the underlying obligation of another person who is the principal obligor to that obligee 2 to the extent that the underlying obligation or the secondary obligation is performed the obligee is not entitled to performance of the other obligation and 3 as between the principal obligor and the secondary obligor it is the principal obligor who ought to perform the underlying obligation or bear the cost of performance.,Suretyship is described as involving a tripartite relationship consisting of a principal obligee who is owed a debt or duty a principal obligor who is responsible for payment of the debt or performance of the duty and a secondary obligor or surety who agrees to answer for the primary obligors debt or duty.,Policy with negotiated collateral security insurance endorsement issued to equipment leasing companys special purpose entity that issued notes under indenture to bank as trustee secured by lease payments unambiguously established suretyship not credit insurance under California law with insurance company as secondary obligor special purpose entity as principal obligor and bank as intended obligee although written as insurance coverage endorsement did not only guarantee lessees credit but all related issues of fraud insolvency bankruptcy and timely performance by the Insured any transferee of the Leases or any interest therein or by any servicer or sub-servicer and promised that unless and until otherwise notified by the Trustee acting under the Indenture the Company shall make all payments hereunder to the Trustee on behalf of the Additional InsuredLoss Payee and not the Insured and insurance company asserted right to indemnification.,While an insurer generally does not have a right of subrogation against its insured a suretyship confers rights of recourse to the surety against the principal obligor.,Under California law generally the fraud of the principal debtor will not relieve the guarantor or surety who acted at the request of the debtor from liability if the creditor did not have notice of the fraud and did not participate therein.,Surety was precluded under California law from denying liability to bank as intended obligee on grounds that surety was fraudulently induced to undertake obligations of allegedly sham equipment leasing companys special purpose entity as principal obligor engaged in Ponzi-type scheme in which early investors were paid with funds obtained from later investors since surety never claimed that bank had either notice of or participated in alleged fraud.,Under California law indicia of an agency relationship are the agents power to alter legal relations between the principal and others a fiduciary relationship and the principals right to control the agents conduct.,Allegedly sham equipment leasing company and its special purpose entity had neither actual nor ostensible authority to act as agent for intended obligee bank under California law as required for surety to be relieved from obligations to bank by imputing to bank alleged fraud of leasing company and its entity engaged in Ponzi-type scheme in which early investors were paid with funds obtained from later investors since surety made no claim that leasing company and its entity were given authority to act as agent for bank or that bank acted in manner that could lead surety to reasonably believe that leasing company or its entity were acting as banks agent.,Under California law a waiver of fraud is not effective against a party whose own fraud induced the contract.,Policy with collateral security insurance endorsement issued to allegedly sham equipment leasing companys special purpose entity that issued notes secured by lease payments under indenture to bank in Ponzi-type scheme in which early investors were paid with funds obtained from later investors was not void for entitys alleged misrepresentations about validity of underlying leases to induce issuance of policy as required for policy issuer to avoid obligations to bank under California suretyship law since endorsement created surety contract with bank as intended obligee and rescission of endorsement was not sought on grounds of banks own fraud.,Surety effectively waived defenses under California law including fraudulent inducement into issuing policy to allegedly sham equipment leasing companys special purpose entity that issued notes secured by lease payments under indenture to bank in Ponzi-type scheme by policys negotiated collateral security insurance endorsement disavowing reliance on any representations by entity or bank and expressly waiving right to assert defenses including but not limited to all issues of entitys fraud insolvency bankruptcy and timely performance since endorsement was product of extended negotiations between sophisticated parties who sculpted provisions that were not boilerplate language.,While the extent of a secondary obligation is generally determined from the surety contract the obligations of a surety must not be greater than that of the principal. Wests Ann.Cal.Civ.Code  2809.,The effect of suretyship status may be varied by contract between the parties subject to it.,Under California law contract construed together with other interrelated transaction documents to find that a suretyship is created as a matter of law cannot be construed separately from the other transaction documents to determine the extent of the suretys liability. Wests Ann.Cal.Civ.Code  2809 2856a1.,Surety did not waive right to limit its obligations under California law owed to bank as intended obligee to not exceed obligations of principal for amounts due under notes pursuant to suretys policy with collateral security insurance endorsement issued to allegedly sham equipment leasing companys special purpose entity that issued notes secured by and to be repaid by lease payments under indenture to bank in Ponzi-type scheme in which early investors were paid with funds obtained from later investors since lease payments were also note payments and parties contemplated that special purpose entity would be entitled to remainder if lease payments exceeded note payments. Wests Ann.Cal.Civ.Code  2809 2856a1.,Court of Appeals reviews the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion except to the extent that it is based on a legal determination that the amendment would not withstand a motion to dismiss.,Factors that may affect the determination of whether to allow leave to amend a pleading when justice so requires include undue delay in filing lack of notice to the opposing party bad faith by the moving party repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendment undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the amendment. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15a 28 U.S.C.A.,Suretys proposed amendment of its counterclaims and answers with respect to intended obligee bank to reflect evidence obtained in discovery about subjective intentions of individuals involved in negotiating surety contract would be unduly delayed prejudicial and futile since surety had ample time to supplement response but unduly delayed motion to amend finding of suretyship was based on substance of transaction as whole not on absence of any facts that could be established in discovery and surety was not entitled to wait in wings for adverse decision before asserting that issue should not have been determined from documents alone. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15a 28 U.S.C.A.,Delay alone will generally not justify the denial of leave to amend however delay will at some point become undue placing an unwarranted burden on the court or prejudicial placing an unfair burden on the opposing party.

Affirmed. ,Court of Appeals reviews the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and accepting as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint however the Court need not adopt a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,A plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.,To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 9b 28 U.S.C.A.,Although conditions of a persons mind may be alleged generally under the rule requiring fraud be pled with particularity the plaintiff still must plead facts about the defendants mental state which accepted as true make the state-of-mind allegation plausible on its face. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 9b 28 U.S.C.A.,Under Kentucky law as predicted by the Court of Appeals allegations of negligent misrepresentation must be pled with particularity.,To plead negligent misrepresentation under Kentucky law a plaintiff must allege inter alia that the defendant supplied false information for the guidance of others in a business transaction.,In Kentucky fraud by misrepresentation comprises six elements 1 the defendant must have made a material misrepresentation 2 that was false 3 that the defendant knew was false or made with reckless disregard for its truth 4 that was intended to induce the plaintiff to act based on the misrepresentation 5 that the plaintiff reasonably relied and 6 that caused the plaintiff injury.,To be actionable for fraud under Kentucky law a misrepresentation must relate to a past or present material fact a mere statement of opinion or prediction may not be the basis of an action.,Under Kentucky law forward-looking opinions about investment prospects or future sales performance generally cannot be the basis for a fraud claim.,Sales talk or puffing which is universal and an expected practice does not amount to actionable misrepresentation under Kentucky law particularly where the parties deal at arms length and have equal means of information.,Under Kentucky law fraud claims based on opinions or predictions may lie where the opinion or prediction either 1 incorporates falsified past or present facts or 2 is so contrary to the true current state of affairs that it is an obvious sham.,Deception exceptions to Kentuckys general rule that mere statement of opinion or prediction cannot be basis of a fraud claim do not relieve market participants particularly experienced participants of their duty to protect themselves.,Kentucky fraud law imposes upon recipients of business representations a duty to exercise common sense.,Sellers alleged statement to investor bank that residential-mortgage-backed securities were reasonably safe investment products was not non-actionable opinion or forward-looking prediction but rather concerned present material fact about the securities foundations and even if statement were opinion or prediction bank as sophisticated institutional investor which bought more than fifty million dollars worth of the securities had obligation to protect itself at least by reading the prospectus supplements which contained descriptions of the risks involved in investing.,Kentucky law presumes that a buyer expects a salesperson to puff his wares the buyer therefore should be on his guard and verify the sellers statements before purchase.,Under Kentucky law investors allegations that broker made false representations that certificates were reasonably safe investment products backed by mortgage loans made according to reasonably prudent underwriting standards were not sufficiently particular to state a claim of fraud where investor failed to indicate when where or to whom the alleged misstatement was made. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 9b 28 U.S.C.A.,Under Kentucky law investors allegations that brokerage firm stated in prospectuses or prospectus supplements that it intended to make a secondary market for certificates but in fact was not able to do so because of its financial weakness were insufficient to state a claim of fraud by misrepresentation such a statement of intent would only be actionable if it were outlandish such that firm knew that what it promised would never happen when it made the statement.,Investor could not have reasonably relied on alleged statement of intent by brokerage firm to make secondary market for mortgage pass-through certificates as required for claim of fraud under Kentucky law where prospectuses and prospectus supplements amply warned of possibility that brokerage would be incapable of following through on its intention and expressly disclaimed any obligation to do so.,Investor could not have reasonably relied on alleged promise by brokerage firm that certificates would be beneficiaries of credit enhancement as required to state a claim of fraud by misrepresentation under Kentucky law where offering documents clearly explained that offered credit enhancement was at risk of being depleted or exhausted and that therefore security-holder bore significant risk of loss.,Unlike fraud by misrepresentation which hinges on an affirmative misstatement under Kentucky law a fraud by omission claim is grounded in a duty to disclose.,Under Kentucky law to prevail on a claim of fraud by omission a plaintiff must prove 1 the defendant had a duty to disclose the material fact at issue 2 the defendant failed to disclose the fact 3 the defendants failure to disclose the material fact induced the plaintiff to act and 4 the plaintiff suffered actual damages as a consequence.,Under Kentucky law if a party might have learned the truth relating to alleged fraudulent omissions by ordinary vigilance and attention it is the partys own folly if he neglected to do so and he is remediless.,Under Kentucky law investors allegations that brokerage firm failed to inform it that substantial number of loans underlying mortgage pass-through certificates had been made without regard for prudent underwriting standards were not sufficiently particular to state a claim of fraud by omission where investor failed to specify the who what when where and how of the alleged omission.

Affirmed. ,On an appeal from a grant of a motion to dismiss Court of Appeals reviews de novo the decision of the district court.,In conducting its de novo review of district courts grant of a motion to dismiss Court of Appeals construes the complaint liberally accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.,A plaintiff claiming securities fraud must allege scienter a mental state embracing intent to deceive manipulate or defraud and must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  10b 21Db2 15 U.S.C.A.  78jb 78u4b2.,The strong inference of scienter that securities fraud plaintiff must allege is one that is more than merely reasonable or permissible it must be cogent and compelling thus strong in light of other explanations. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  10b 21Db2 15 U.S.C.A.  78jb 78u4b2.,Securities fraud plaintiff may establish the requisite strong inference of scienter by alleging either 1 that defendants had the motive and opportunity to commit fraud or 2 strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  10b 21Db2 15 U.S.C.A.  78jb 78u4b2.,Breaches of contract generally fall outside the scope of the securities laws.,Private securities fraud action based on a contractual breach may succeed if there are particularized allegations that the contract itself was a misrepresentation that is that the plaintiffs loss was caused by reliance upon the defendants specific promise to perform particular acts while never intending to perform those acts. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  10b 15 U.S.C.A.  78jb.,Although contractual breach in connection with securities transaction in and of itself does not bespeak fraud it may constitute fraud where the breaching party never intended to perform its material obligations under the contract. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  10b 15 U.S.C.A.  78jb.,Security fraud plaintiffs allegation of a simple disagreement over the meaning of an ambiguous contract combined with a conclusory allegation of intent to breach at the time of execution are insufficient to raise the requisite strong inference of scienter either the alleged breach must be of a character that alone provides strong circumstantial evidence of an intent to deceive at the time of contract formation or there must be allegations of particularized facts supporting a cogent and compelling inference of that intent.

The United States District Court for the District of Delaware Joseph J. Farnan Jr. J. 2005 WL 440798 affirmed and indenture trustee appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Van Antwerpen Circuit Judge held that Bankruptcy Court erred by double discounting when it discounted the principal component of the claims against Chapter 11 debtor to present value after also having disallowed the post-petition interest portion of the claims.  Reversed.  Smith Circuit Judge filed dissenting opinion. ,Court of Appeals exercises plenary review over a bankruptcy courts legal decisions and application of law to fact.,Indenture trustees claims against debtor under guarantee obligating debtor to take over payment of principal and interest to trust certificate holders in the event of any shortfalls consisted of separable interest and principal components and did not merely represent a singular future liability.,Bankruptcy court erred by double discounting when it discounted the principal component of the claims against Chapter 11 debtor to present value after also having disallowed the post-petition interest portion of the claims bankruptcy court could have either disallowed post-petition interest or discounted the entire claim to present value but not both. 11 U.S.C.A.  502b2.,Interest-bearing debt should not be discounted to present value after unmatured interest has been disallowed pursuant to Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C.A.  502b2.
../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./001 - Microsoft Corp v Motorola Inc.txt, Background Software developer brought breach of contract action alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND terms. After case was consolidated with patentees patent infringement action the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington James L. Robart J. 2013 WL 6000017 entered judgment in developers favor and patentee appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Lourie Circuit Judge 564 Fed.Appx. 586 granted developers motion to transfer appeal.  Holdings Following transfer the Court of Appeals Berzon Circuit Judge held that  1 Court of Appeals had jurisdiction  2 patentee waived its argument that district court lacked authority to decide RAND rate  3 district courts partial present-day focus did not render invalid its determination of RAND rate  4 district courts determination of RAND rate was not based on legal error or clearly erroneous view of facts  5 question of whether patentee breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing was for jury and  6 developers recovery of attorneys fees and litigation costs were not barred by NoerrPennington doctrine or Washington law.  Affirmed. ,Law of the case doctrine does not apply if 1 the first decision was clearly erroneous2 there has been an intervening change in the law3 the evidence on remand is substantially different4 other changed circumstances exist or 5 a manifest injustice would otherwise result.,Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over interlocutory appeal in software developers breach of contract action alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND terms while patentee argued that district court constructively amended complaint by holding bench trial on RAND rate tacitly invoking changed circumstances exception to law of the case doctrine prior jurisdictional determination was made knowing bench trial would occur and Federal Circuits decision to transfer case to Court of Appeals was made after bench trial and there was no clear error or manifest injustice to justify disrupting courts prior jurisdictional determinations.,Not all cases involving a patent-law claim fall within the Federal Circuits jurisdiction.,Complaint that alleges breach of contract and seeks damages sounds in contract its nature does not change because the contract is a patent license.,Patentee affirmatively consented to bench-trial determination of reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND royalty rate in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms thus waiving any argument that court lacked authority to decide RAND rate where patentees counsel informed court at status conference that parties had agreed that court would decide all material terms of RAND license patentee was not misled as to connection between RAND determination and breach-of-contract jury trial and it did not cabin its consent to license-setting scenario and court made parties aware that RAND determination was being made to set stage for breach of contract trial.,Result of bench trial to determine reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND royalty rate in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms was not advisory opinion outside of courts authority where rate was vigorously disputed by parties from outset of case rate was understood by both court and parties as essential factual aspect of breach-of-contract determination by jury and far from maintaining irrelevance of RAND rate determination to ultimate jury verdict patentee challenged jury verdict as impermissibly influenced by RAND rate determination. U.S.C.A. Const. art. 3.,Federal Circuits patent law methodology can serve as guidance in contract cases on questions of patent valuation.,Under hypothetical agreement approach courts partial present-day focus did not render invalid its determination of reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND royalty rate in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms where developer argued that patentees breach was ongoing and failed to specify any past date court should have used it was impracticable for court to consider only such evidence as could pinpoint value of subject patents to developer at precise point in time because data presented was not pinpointed to any specific past date and patentee was not prejudiced by courts analysis.,Courts determination of reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND royalty rate and range was not based on legal error or clearly erroneous view of facts in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms even though patentee objected to courts conclusions that rates charged by two patent pools were relevant indicators of RAND rate and that patentees historical licenses were not where patentee was not prejudiced by courts assumption that its patents were of roughly equal value to those in pool as they probably were worth less and it was reasonable to determine that past licenses were too contextually dissimilar to be useful in calculating RAND rate.,Question as to whether patentee breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing either through its opening offers or its pursuit of injunctive relief was for jury in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND terms.,Court of Appeals reviews the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and must affirm where there is substantial evidence supporting a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.,NoerrPennington doctrine ensures that those who petition any department of the government including the courts are immune from liability for their petitioning conduct though the doctrine creates an exception for sham litigation defined as private action that is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action as opposed to a valid effort to influence government action. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,NoerrPennington doctrine does not immunize a party from actions that amount to a breach of contract.,Because the NoerrPennington doctrine grows out of the Petition Clause its reach extends only so far as necessary to steer clear of violating the First Amendment. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Enforcing a contractual commitment to refrain from litigation does not violate the First Amendment if it did every settlement of a lawsuit would be unenforceable as a NoerrPennington violation. U.S.C.A.

U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,Washington law recognizes four equitable exceptions to the American rule of not awarding attorney fees as costs absent a contract statute or equitable exception 1 the common fund theory 2 actions by a third person subjecting a party to litigation 3 bad faith or misconduct of a party and 4 dissolving wrongfully issued temporary injunctions or restraining orders.,There are three types of bad faith that Washington law recognizes under the bad faith equitable exception to the American rule of not awarding attorney fees as costs absent a contract statute or equitable exception 1 prelitigation misconduct 2 procedural bad faith and 3 substantive bad faith.,Procedural bad faith as one of the three types of bad faith that Washington law recognizes under the bad faith equitable exception to the American rule of not awarding attorney fees as costs absent a contract statute or equitable exception is defined as vexatious conduct during litigation unrelated to the merits of the case.,Attorney fees that software developer sought to recover as damages in its breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND terms were distinct from same-suit fees generally banned by American rule applied under Washington law and instead they were best characterized as recoverable consequential contract damages ordinarily recoverable in breach of contract suits where fees were not incurred in current breach of contract action but rather in defending against patentees prior injunctive action that was found to have breached RAND agreement.,Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.,If the Court of Appeals determines that evidence was improperly admitted or excluded at trial remand is required for a new trial unless the beneficiary of the error can prove that it is more probable than not that the jury would have reached the same verdict.,In breach of contract action patentee waived any objection to admission to jury of reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND rates and ranges determined in prior bench trial in software developers suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms where patentee consented to bench trial which was intended to identify RAND rate for use in evaluating breach of contract claim.,Patentee consented to submission to jury of facts underlying courts determination of reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND rates and ranges in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on RAND terms where patentee knew trial court would make those foundational findings when it consented to bench trial on RAND rate and that RAND rates and ranges would be introduced at subsequent jury trial on breach of contract claim and those rates and ranges would have had little meaning if facts supporting them were not also admitted.,Under the rule of curative admissibility or the opening-the-door doctrine the introduction of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an opponent in the courts discretion to introduce evidence on the same issue to rebut any false impression that might have resulted from the earlier admission.,Testimony of software developers deputy general counsel regarding investigation by Federal Trade Commission FTC of patentees enforcement policy regarding its standard essential patents was not barred by rule prohibiting introduction of evidence of compromise offers and negotiations in software developers breach of contract suit alleging that patentee improperly refused to offer it licenses for use of foreign and domestic standard essential patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory RAND terms testimony was admitted only to show that patentees were aware FTC and developer found its conduct questionable enough to merit investigation and court promptly and adequately cured any prejudicial impact of testimony going beyond that scope.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./002 - Enfish LLC v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Owner of patents directed to an information management and database system brought action against competitors alleging infringement. The United States District Court for the Central District of California Mariana R. Pfaelzer Senior Judge 56 F.Supp.3d 1167 granted competitors motion for summary judgment on basis of unpatentability. Owner appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Hughes Circuit Judge held that  1 patent claims at issue were not directed to abstract idea  2 algorithm in patents recited sufficient structure for claimed function  3 pivot table feature in competitors program did not anticipate claims at issue  4 owners claimed three-step algorithm was sole equivalent structure for means for indexing claim and  5 competitors product did not use identical or equivalent structure disclosed in algorithm.  Affirmed in part vacated in part reversed in part and remanded. ,Court of Appeals will review de novo a district courts grant of summary judgment.,When the Court of Appeals reviews a district courts grant of summary judgment the evidence of the non-movant is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the non-movants favor. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56a 28 U.S.C.A.,Court of Appeals will review de novo a district courts determination that the patent claims at issue in an infringement suit do not claim patent-eligible subject matter. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Laws of nature natural phenomena and abstract ideas are not patentable. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,To determine the patentability of a patents subject matter the court must first determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept and if this threshold determination is met the court moves to the second step of the inquiry and considers the elements of each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,When determining the patentability of a patents subject matter the directed to inquiry does not simply ask whether the claims involve a patent-ineligible concept because essentially every routinely patent-eligible claim involving physical products and actions involves a law of nature andor natural phenomenon rather the directed to inquiry applies a stage-one filter to claims considered in light of the specification based on whether their character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Claims in patent directed to information management and database system were not directed to abstract idea of organizing information using tabular formats but were instead directed to specific improvement to way computers operate embodied in self-referential table and thus claims were not invalid as directed to unpatentable subject matter even though invention could be run on general-purpose computer and was not defined by reference to physical components claims were directed to improvement in computers functioning and were specifically directed to self-referential table for computer database rather than any form of storing tabular data and specification taught that self-referential table functioned differently than conventional database structures and achieved other benefits over conventional databases. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Construction of a means-plus-function limitation includes two steps first the court must determine the claimed function and second the court must identify the corresponding structure in the written description of the patent that performs the function. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Algorithm in patents directed to information management and database system recited sufficient structure for claimed function of configuring said memory according to logical table and thus claim at issue was not invalid for indefiniteness even though algorithm relied in part on techniques known to person of skill in art where algorithms first step relied on well-known techniques in database arts for setting up table in computer memory and remaining steps provided particular details for modifying some such well-known configurations in accordance with disclosed invention. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For a patent claim element recited in means-plus-function format the specification must contain sufficient descriptive text by which a person of skill in the field of the invention would know and understand what structure corresponds to the means limitation. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For a patent claim element recited in means-plus-function format the patentee need not disclose details of structures well known in the art but the specification must nonetheless disclose some structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For a patent claim element recited in means-plus-function format the sufficiency of the structure is viewed through the lens of a person of skill in the art and without need to disclose structures well known in the art. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Pivot table feature in competitors software program did not anticipate claims at issue in patents directed to information management and database system and thus claims were not invalid as anticipated where competitors feature involved one table referencing column in another table but patents required table to have self-referencing feature by way of matching-ID language. 35 U.S.C.A.  102b.,Patent anticipation requires that the reference describe not only the elements of the claimed invention but also that it describe those elements arranged as in the claim. 35 U.S.C.A.  102.,For a patent claim element recited in means-plus-function format the corresponding structure for a function performed by a software algorithm is the algorithm itself. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Patent owners claimed three-step algorithm was sole equivalent structure for means for indexing claim in patents directed to information management and database system where two figures in specification were not alternative embodiments but rather one figure was not index but rather was intermediate compilation of keyword values used in process of forming index text cells contained references to keywords contained therein and when index was ultimately formed as illustrated in second figure index entries contained references to text cells that through use of keywords contained references to index. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Competitors software product did not use identical or equivalent structure disclosed in algorithm interpreted as means-plus-function claim in patents directed to information management and database system and thus product did not infringe patents where step two of algorithm required storing extracted key phrases or words in index but competitors product stored references to cells containing text values and step three of algorithm required inclusion of pointers to corresponding entries in the index in cells with text values but competitors product stored pointers to other objects that by use of further chain of pointers could be resolved to index and differences between invention and accused product were not insubstantial. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,For an accused product to practice a claim element interpreted as a means-plus-function claim the accused product must perform the identical function using an identical or equivalent structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Accused structure is equivalent to a disclosed structure as required for an accused product to practice a claim element interpreted as a means-plus-function claim if the differences between the two are insubstantial. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,US Patent 6151604 US Patent 6163775.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./003 - i4i Ltd Partnership v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Owner of patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents brought infringement action against competitor. Following claim construction 2009 WL 2960402 and a jury verdict for owner awarding 200 million in damages the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Leonard Davis J. 670 F.Supp.2d 568 denied competitors motions for judgment as a matter of law and motions for a new trial awarded 40 million in additional damages and granted owners motion for a permanent injunction. Competitor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Prost Circuit Judge held that  1 term distinct did not require storage in separate files or independent manipulation of the metacode and mapped content  2 sufficient evidence supported jurys finding that patent was not anticipated by the sale of prior art software  3 sufficient evidence supported finding of direct infringement of method claims  4 substantial evidence supported finding of contributory infringement  5 substantial evidence supported finding of induced infringement  6 damages award of 200 million was not clearly excessive  7 evidence was sufficient to establish that infringement was willful and  8 district court did not abuse its discretion in granting permanent injunction.  Affirmed as modified.  Opinion 589 F.3d 1246 superseded and withdrawn on rehearing. ,For issues not unique to patent law the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in reviewing a patent law case applies the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal would otherwise lie.,Under Fifth Circuit law a court of appeals reviews denials of judgment as a matter of law JMOL de novo.,Under Fifth Circuit law a court of appeals reviews the denial of a new trial motion for abuse of discretion a court will not reverse a denial absent a clear showing of an absolute absence of evidence to support the jurys verdict.,Under Fifth Circuit law a court of appeals reviews jury instructions for abuse of discretion cognizant of the district courts broad discretion to compose jury instructions so long as the instructions accurately describe the law a court will reverse a judgment only if the jury instructions as a whole create a substantial doubt as to whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.,Under Fifth Circuit law erroneous jury instructions are subject to harmless error review a court will not reverse if considering the record as a whole the erroneous instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case.,Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews a district courts patent claim construction de novo.,To ascertain the scope and meaning of asserted patent claims a court looks to the words of the claims themselves the specification and the prosecution history.,Term distinct as used to describe how the metacode map and the map content were stored in patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents did not require storage in separate files.,Term distinct as used to describe how the metacode map and the map content were stored in patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents did not require independent manipulation of the metacode and mapped content.,Generally a patent claim is not limited to the embodiments described in the specification unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claims scope with words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction by the same token not every benefit flowing from an invention is a claim limitation.,Although obviousness in a patent infringement case is a question of law it is based on factual underpinnings.,In reviewing a patent infringement case the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews de novo whether the claimed invention would have been obvious.,In infringement action brought against competitor by owner of patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents competitors filing of a pre-verdict judgment as a matter of law JMOL on anticipation based on one prior art reference was insufficient to preserve its right to post-verdict judgment as a matter of law JMOL on obviousness or on other prior art.,In a patent infringement case a party must file a pre-verdict judgment as a matter of law JMOL motion on all theories and with respect to all prior art references that it wishes to challenge with a post-verdict JMOL.,To prove invalidity of a patent by the on-sale bar a challenger must show by clear and convincing evidence that the claimed invention was on sale in the United States more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States. 35 U.S.C.A.  102b.,In a patent infringement case anticipation is an affirmative defense. 35 U.S.C.A.  102b.,In patent infringement case corroboration of expert testimony offered in response to a claim of anticipation and pertaining to whether the prior art practiced the claimed invention is not required.,Evidence was sufficient to support jurys finding that patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents was not anticipated by the sale of prior art software program jury heard conflicting testimony on whether the prior art met the patents metacode map limitation.,A challenger is required to prove the invalidity of a patent by clear and convincing evidence.,District court did not abuse its discretion by using the term component rather than material or apparatus in jury instructions for contributory infringement in patent infringement case brought by owner of patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents although the district courts instructions differed from the corresponding statute the parties infringement arguments did not turn on whether the accused product was a component versus a material or apparatus and there was no evidence that the jury was aware of any difference or would have viewed the difference as anything but semantics had it known because both parties used the terms interchangeably at trial. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,In patent infringement case brought against competitor by owner of patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents district court did not abuse its discretion by instructing the jury to focus on custom extensible markup language XML editor within competitors larger software package rather than all of the software package when deciding whether any noninfringing uses were substantial so as to constitute contributory infringement in light of evidence that some versions of the software package included the editor while others did not and testimony opining that the ability to leave the editor out or put it in various products showed that the editor was a separate and distinct feature. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,A particular tool within a larger software package may be the relevant material or apparatus for contributory infringement purposes of patent law when that tool is a separate and distinct feature. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,Patent infringement is a question of fact.,Where patent infringement is tried to a jury the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews the verdict only for substantial evidence.,Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit must set aside a general verdict in a patent infringement case if the jury was told it could rely on any of two or more independent legal theories one of which was defective however the Court of Appeals will not set aside a general verdict of infringement simply because the jury might have decided on a ground that was supported by insufficient evidence and will uphold such a verdict if there was sufficient evidence to support any of the plaintiffs alternative factual theories assuming the jury considered all the evidence and relied upon a factual theory for which the burden of proof was satisfied.,Sufficient evidence supported finding of direct infringement of method claims of patent relating to a method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents as required for patent owner to succeed in its infringement case against competitor on a theory of contributory or induced infringement in light of testimony of patent owners expert stating that the patent was infringed if accused software was used to open an extensible markup language XML document edit an XML document or save a document containing custom XML in an XML file format and joint stipulation and competitors interrogatory responses unequivocally stating that the accused software was used in those ways.,Direct infringement of method patent claims occurs only when someone performs the claimed method.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding in reaching verdict that competitor infringed patent relating to method for processing and storing information about structure of electronic documents under contributory infringement theory that custom extensible markup language XML editor in accused word-processing software had no substantial noninfringing uses and that competitor knew that use of editor would infringe patent expert testified that custom XML editor could be used in three noninfringing ways but opined that none were substantial and despite evidence that some users of accused software saved XML documents in noninfringing formats there was ample testimony that the noninfringing format was not a practical or worthwhile use. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,Whether a use is substantial for contributory infringement purposes under patent law rather than just unusual far-fetched illusory impractical occasional aberrant or experimental cannot be evaluated in a vacuum. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding in reaching verdict that competitor infringed patent relating to method for processing and storing information about the structure of electronic documents under induced infringement theory that competitor had the affirmative intent to cause direct infringement competitors online training and user support resources provided detailed instructions on using accused word-processing softwares infringing custom extensible markup language XML editor patent owners expert testified that using the editor as directed by those materials would infringe the patent and competitors internal e-mails showed both knowledge of both patent and infringing nature of accused softwares custom XML editor.,To prove inducement a patentee must show direct infringement and that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage anothers infringement.,Under Fifth Circuit law a court of appeals reviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.,Under Daubert a district court is required to ensure that any scientific testimony is not only relevant but reliable when the methodology is sound and the evidence relied upon sufficiently related to the case at hand disputes about the degree of relevance or accuracy above this minimum threshold may go to the testimonys weight but not its admissibility. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,District court did not abuse its discretion in patent infringement action when it admitted testimony of patent owners expert who opined that a reasonable damages award would be 200 million dollars based on a hypothetical negotiation between patent owner and competitor at the time infringement began expert testified about acceptance of hypothetical negotiation model among damage experts and economists gave methodical explication of how he applied the model to the relevant facts and drew relevant facts from competitors internal documents publicly available information about other software similar to accused software and a survey designed to estimate amount of infringing use.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./187 - Novell Inc v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Software developer brought antitrust claims against manufacturer of computer operating system software. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland J. Frederick Motz J. declined to dismiss claims alleging that defendants conduct injured competition in market for personal computer PC operating systems which was market in which developers products did not directly compete but dismissed other claims as untimely. Parties filed interlocutory appeal.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Duncan Circuit Judge held that  1 antitrust standing to bring private treble damages claims under Sherman Act for injuries allegedly suffered as result of anticompetitive conduct was not limited only to consumers or competitors in relevant market  2 developer stated that it suffered antitrust injury  3 causal connection existed between antitrust injury alleged by developer and alleged violations of antitrust laws by manufacturer  4 developer that was outside of restrained PC operating systems market nevertheless was direct victim of alleged anticompetitive conduct of manufacturer  5 developer could not benefit from Clayton Act provision for tolling statute of limitations for bringing antitrust claim as to office productivity applications market.  Affirmed. ,Antitrust standing to bring private treble damages claims under Sherman Act for injuries allegedly suffered as result of anticompetitive conduct was not limited only to consumers or competitors in relevant market. Sherman Act  1 2 15 U.S.C.A.  1 2 Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,The concept of antitrust standing under the Sherman Act is narrower than constitutional standing harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact but courts must make an independent determination of whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,A plaintiffs status as a consumer or a competitor in the restrained market is relevant to the issue of antitrust standing under the Sherman Act. Sherman Act  1 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,Word processing software developer stated that it suffered antitrust injury under Sherman Act on allegations that manufacturer of computer operating system software engaged in activities that were intended to and did restrain competition in personal computer PC operating-system market by keeping barriers to entry into that market high. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,A firm violates the Sherman Act when it acquires or maintains or attempts to acquire or maintain a monopoly by engaging in exclusionary conduct as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of superior product business acumen or historic accident. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,Causal connection existed between Sherman Act antitrust injury alleged by word processing software developer and alleged violations of antitrust laws by manufacturer of computer operating system software where manufacturer allegedly made use of its monopoly power in operating-system market to foreclose distribution channels for developers applications manufacturer withheld crucial data on its soon-to-be-released operating system to put developer at competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis manufacturers office-productivity applications manufacturer specifically targeted developers products for destruction as means to damage competition in operating-systems market. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,Word processing software developer that was outside of restrained personal computer PC operating systems market nevertheless was direct victim of alleged anticompetitive conduct of manufacturer of computer operating system software and thus had standing under Clayton Act to pursue monopoly power claim against manufacturer since among other things popularity quality and ability of developers software applications to function well on multiple operating systems posed potential threat to manufacturers monopoly by offering bridge across applications barrier to entry into that market by competing PC operating systems manufacturer did not have more direct victim than developer and manufacturer was dominate within field. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Anti-trust law favors granting standing to the most direct victims of defendants anticompetitive conduct and denying standing to more remote victims on the theory that the direct victims have the greatest motivation to act as private attorneys general and to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,The existence of an identifiable more-directly harmed class of victims with the incentive to sue under the antitrust laws weighs against granting standing to a more remote plaintiff. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Office productivity applications market at issue in subsequent monopoly power action brought by software developer against manufacturer of computer operating system software was neither identical to nor completely encompassed by personal computer PC operating system market and Internet browser market at issue in governments prior monopoly power action against manufacturer and thus developer could not benefit from Clayton Act provision for tolling statute of limitations for bringing antitrust claim. Sherman Act  1 2 15 U.S.C.A.  1 2 Clayton Act  4B 5i 15 U.S.C.A.  15b 16i.,The tolling provision under the Clayton Act contemplates an analysis of the relationship between the violations alleged in the government action and those alleged in the private action. Clayton Act  5i 15 U.S.C.A.  16i.,For the Clayton Act tolling provision to apply the private plaintiffs must prove by comparison of the two complaints on their faces a significant overlap of subject matter between the two actions however there is no requirement of complete identity of the means objectives or statutory violations in the public and private lawsuits.

The United States District Court for the District of Maryland at Baltimore J. Frederick Motz J. 437 F.Supp.2d 497 granted summary judgment for provider. Manufacturer appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Wilkinson Circuit Judge held that  1 district courts order dismissing certain claims without prejudice was final  2 district court had authority to rescind its initial approval of manufacturers notice of voluntary dismissal and  3 action was time-barred.  Affirmed.  Hamilton Senior Circuit Judge concurred in part concurred in the judgment and filed an opinion. ,Generally an antitrust cause of action accrues and the four-year statute of limitations begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiffs business. Clayton Act  4B 15 U.S.C.A.  15b.,District court order dismissing without prejudice claims brought by manufacturer of pen operated software system against large provider of personal computer software based upon antitrust injuries allegedly suffered by company that had acquired manufacturers assets was final decision and thus Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to consider appeal from order when district court dismissed claims without prejudice it was utterly finished with manufacturers case and the claims were based on injuries to company that manufacturer never had a right to allege. 28 U.S.C.A.  1291.,Finality rule that courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts carries out the twin purposes of avoiding the enfeebling of judicial administration that comes with undue delay of ongoing district court proceedings and preserving the primacy of the district court as the arbiter of the proceedings before it. 28 U.S.C.A.  1291.,What makes dismissals without prejudice final or nonfinal for purposes of jurisdiction of courts of appeals is not the speculative possibility of a new lawsuit but that they end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment. 28 U.S.C.A.  1291.,Rule governing voluntary dismissals did not constrain district court in its discretion to rescind its order granting plaintiffs voluntary dismissal. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 41a2 28 U.S.C.App.2000 Ed.,The primary force of rule governing voluntary dismissals is to empower district courts to exercise discretion over voluntary dismissals. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 41a2 28 U.S.C.App.2000 Ed.,Clear error of law and risk of manifest injustice warranted district courts granting motion to amend or alter judgment which permitted through accident plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss all claims district court meant to permit voluntary dismissal for only one claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 59e 28 U.S.C.A.,District court had authority to grant relief from judgment which had permitted through accident plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss all claims where district court meant to permit voluntary dismissal for only one claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 60b 28 U.S.C.A.,Manufacturer of pen operated software system had inquiry notice that large provider of personal computer software had engaged in anticompetitive conduct thereby triggering commencement of four-year statute of limitations governing antitrust claims no later than when manufacturer had twice met with the Federal Trade Commission FTC concerning its investigation of provider and submitted declaration reporting specific conversations in which original equipment manufacturers had told manufacturer that providers licensing arrangements made pre-installing manufacturers software either prohibitively expensive or altogether prohibited reported rumors that provider was warning software developers and hardware manufacturers not to do business with manufacturer suggested that providers own pen operated software was based on manufacturers trade secrets and when after seeing demonstration of providers pen operated software manufacturer went to a law firm to discuss an intellectual property suit against provider which firm thought was strong. Clayton Act  4B 15 U.S.C.A.  15b.,Fraudulent concealment is an equitable doctrine read into every federal statute of limitation which does not stop the clock but rather moves the clock starting it from when the wrong was discovered rather than when it was committed.,The doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolling limitations period only applies when there has been no negligence or laches on the part of a plaintiff in coming to knowledge of the fraud.,Doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies when claimant establishes that the party pleading the statute of limitations fraudulently concealed facts which are the basis of a claim and that the claimant failed to discover those facts within the statutory period despite the exercise of due diligence.,Where a plaintiff knows of a pattern of particular actions that a defendant has taken against him though the patterns precise scope might be unclear and its exact legal ramifications uncertain the plaintiff is on inquiry notice of his claim for purposes of statute of limitations.,Inquiry notice as would begin running of limitations period is triggered by evidence of the possibility of fraud not by complete exposure of the alleged scam.

Reversed and remanded. ,A party that is not adversely affected by a judgment lacks standing to appeal or to cross-appeal.,Where the appellant lacks standing Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to decide the appeal and the same rule necessarily applies to cross-appeals.,Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over defendant competitors cross-appeal challenging district courts dismissal of competitors non-infringement claims taken in response to patent owners appeal of courts judgment of patent invalidity because competitors rights under judgment of invalidity were actually broader than its rights would be under a judgment of non-infringement competitor was not adversely affected by the district courts judgment.,A party may cross-appeal if adversely affected by the appealed judgment in some particular which it seeks to have modified.,It is only necessary and appropriate to file a cross-appeal when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment thus a cross-appeal is proper only when acceptance of the argument advanced would result in a reversal or modification of the judgment rather than an affirmance.,Where the district court has entered a judgment of patent invalidity as to all of the asserted claims there is no basis for a cross-appeal as to either 1 additional claims for invalidity or 2 claims of non-infringement a judgment that patent claims are invalid eliminates as a practical matter the need to consider on appeal whether those claims are infringed even if the accused infringer has filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement.,Although a judgment of patent non-infringement does not necessarily moot validity issues on appeal a judgment of invalidity necessarily moots the issue of infringement because a determination of infringement applies only to a specific accused product or process whereas invalidity operates as a complete defense to infringement for any product forever.,Three-judge panel of Court of Appeals was not bound to follow order of single judge of the Court that denied appellants motion to dismiss cross-appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./214 - Novell Inc v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Independent software vendor ISV brought action against manufacturer of computer operating system software alleging manufacturer engaged in monopoly activities in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The United States District Court for the District of Utah J. Frederick Motz J. 2012 WL 2913234 entered judgment in manufacturers favor. ISV appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Gorsuch Circuit Judge held that  1 manufacturers withdrawal of prior dealing with ISV did not violate anti-monopoly provision of Sherman Anti-Trust Act and  2 manufacturers alleged deception did was not cause of ISVs injuries.  Affirmed. ,To prevail on a monopoly claim under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act a plaintiff generally must show the defendant possessed sufficient market power to raise prices substantially above a competitive level without losing so much business that the gambit becomes unprofitable that defendant achieved or maintained that market power through the use of anticompetitive conduct and that plaintiffs injuries were caused by the defendants anticompetitive conduct. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,Monopoly misconduct usually involves some assay by the alleged monopolist into the marketplaceto limit the abilities of third parties to deal with rivals to require third parties to purchase a bundle of goods rather than just the ones they really want or to defraud regulators or consumers by contrast and as a general rule purely unilateral conduct does not constitute monopoly misconduct as businesses are free to choose whether or not to do business with others and free to assign what prices they hope to secure for their own products. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,Independent firms competing against one another is almost always good for the consumer and thus warrants a strong presumption of legality in an action alleging a monopoly claim under Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,Though rare liability under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act can sometimes be assigned even when the monopolist engages in purely unilateral conduct such as predatory pricing or refusal to deal supplies. Sherman Act  2 15 U.S.C.A.  2.,To invoke the limited exception to the general rule of firm independence in an action alleging a monopoly claim under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act based on the alleged monopolists discontinuation of a preexisting course of dealing there must be a preexisting voluntary and presumably profitable course of dealing between the monopolist and rival and second the monopolists discontinuation of the preexisting course of dealing must suggest an irrational willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anti-competitive end.

Plaintiffs appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Niemeyer Circuit Judge held that individual class representatives did not satisfy typicality requirement as to businesses who purchased software through special pricing program.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./226 - Kloth v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Multiple federal and state antitrust claims were brought by computer purchasers against manufacturer of computer operating system software. Claims were transferred and consolidated. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland J. Frederick Motz J. dismissed claims of indirect purchasers 127 F.Supp.2d 702. Indirect purchasers appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Niemeyer Circuit Judge held that  1 plaintiffs were indirect purchasers who sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue manufacturer  2 purchasers right of refund did not establish direct economic relationship with regard to software license  3 judicial estoppel doctrine did not apply to prevent manufacturer from asserting that it sold software to intermediaries  4 superseding market forces exception to indirect purchaser doctrine did not apply  5 deprivation of benefits of competitive technology was injury too remote to provide antitrust standing  6 prohibition against reselling operating software in secondary or used market was injury too remote to provide antitrust standing  7 degradation of computers by integration of manufacturers Internet web browser with operating system was injury too remote to provide antitrust standing and  8 district court did not abuse its discretion under doctrine of laches in dismissing equitable claims for injunctive relief.  Affirmed. ,Purchasers of new computers with installed software were indirect purchasers who sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue manufacturer of computer operating system software for damages under federal antitrust law where purchasers acquired their licenses by purchases from intermediaries such as original equipment manufacturers OEMs and retailers and paid them not manufacturer of computer operating system software for their licenses at prices set by OEMs and retailers. Sherman Act  2 4 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15.,Right to refund from manufacturer of computer operating system software that purchasers of new computers with installed software had under end-user license agreements EULA did not establish direct economic relationship with regard to software license and thus purchasers could not maintain action for damages against software manufacturer under federal antitrust law due to lack of standing since such relationship did not establish that purchasers paid software manufacturer for software licenses and obligation did not give software manufacturer ability to control retail prices set by original equipment manufacturers OEMs and retailers for sale of license agreements. Sherman Act  2 4 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15.,Judicial estoppel doctrine did not apply to prevent software manufacturer from asserting that it sold software to intermediaries for purpose of manufacturers claim that purchasers of new computers with installed software did not have antitrust standing to sue it although manufacturer may have argued in past that it did not sell title to its software manufacturer did not deny selling right to original equipment manufacturers OEMs to charge consumers for licenses or options to enter into licenses and thus manufacturer did not rely on mutually inconsistent positions. Sherman Act  2 4 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15.,Superseding market forces exception to indirect purchaser doctrine did not apply to suit brought by purchasers of new computers with installed software against manufacturer of computer operating system software under federal antitrust law since licenses or license-options were purchased from original equipment manufacturers OEMs and retailers and prices were established by OEMs and retailers not by software manufacturer although licenses purchased from OEMs and retailers gave purchasers financial rights against software manufacturer economic transaction for license was consummated with intermediaries at prices fixed by intermediaries. Sherman Act  2 4 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15.,Alleged injury sustained by purchasers of new computers with installed software that they had been deprived of benefits of competitive technology by software manufacturers conduct was too remote to give purchasers standing to sue manufacturer under federal antitrust law for damages for illegal overcharges passed on by intermediaries. Sherman Act  2 4 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15.,Alleged injuries sustained by purchasers of new computers with installed software that restrictions imposed in end-user license agreements EULA made it more difficult for them to obtain reimbursements and prohibited them from reselling operating software in secondary or used market were too remote to give purchasers standing to sue software manufacturer under federal antitrust law for damages for illegal overcharges passed on by intermediaries since original equipment manufacturers OEMs and retailers purchased right to offer consumers restrictive end-user licenses they suffered exactly same antitrust injury as purchasers and they could have made same claim. Sherman Act  2 4 16 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15 26.,Alleged injury sustained by purchasers of new computers with installed software that their computers were degraded by integration of software manufacturers Internet web browser with operating system was too remote to give purchasers standing to sue software manufacturer under federal antitrust law for damages for illegal overcharges passed on by intermediaries any such damage may have provided basis for some type of product liability injury but not claim for antitrust injury. Sherman Act  2 4 16 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15 26.,Purchasers of new computers with installed software did not have standing to maintain antitrust action against software manufacturer to recover threefold damages for injury to their business or property on allegation that software manufacturers conduct deprived them of benefits of competitive technology since alleged injury was too generalized or speculative and so diffuse that it could not be adequately measured. Sherman Act  2 4 16 15 U.S.C.A.  2 15 26.,To have standing to maintain an antitrust action to recover threefold damages for injury to his business or property plaintiffs must demonstrate direct antitrust-type injury not simply any injury that was caused by an antitrust violation. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,To determine whether a person has sustained direct antitrust-type injury to his business or property a court must consider 1 the causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiffs and whether that harm was intended 2 whether the harm was of a type that Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws 3 the directness of the alleged injury 4 the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust injury and 5 problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among those directly and indirectly harmed. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Where the purported injuries amount to generalized or abstract societal harms plaintiffs cannot claim that they as distinct from others in society were specifically injured in their business or property by the alleged antitrust violation as required to have standing to maintain an antitrust action to recover threefold damages for injury to his business or property. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Alleged injuries suffered by purchasers of new computers with installed software that restrictions imposed in end-user license agreements EULA made it more difficult for them to obtain reimbursements and that they were prohibited them from reselling operating software in secondary or used market were too generalized or speculative to provide standing to maintain antitrust action against software manufacturer to recover threefold damages for injury to their business or property since retailers and original equipment manufacturers OEMs were more direct victims and it was too costly for court to discern allocation of such damages. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,Alleged injuries suffered by purchasers of new computers with installed software that their computers were degraded by integration of software manufacturers Internet web browser with operating system were too generalized or speculative to provide standing to maintain antitrust action against software manufacturer to recover threefold damages for injury to their business or property since manufacturer did not intend to cause such harm to purchasers computers and such alleged injury did not have purpose of lessening competition. Clayton Act  4 15 U.S.C.A.  15.,District court did not abuse its discretion under doctrine of laches in dismissing equitable claims for injunctive relief brought by purchasers of new computers with installed software due to prejudice suffered by software manufacturer since purchasers filed generalized claim for injunctive relief and waited more than four years before articulating nature of injunctive relief that they were seeking delay made it impossible for manufacturer to coordinate any consideration of remedies with litigation brought by United States in then pending other related action and without application of laches further litigation over proposed consent decree in other action would have been required.
../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./227 - Z4 Technologies Inc v Microsoft Corp.txt, Background Assignee of patents related to prevention of software piracy sued competitor for infringement. After jury found that competitor had infringed patents and did not prove that patents were invalid the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas Leonard Davis J. 2006 WL 2401099denied competitors renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law and motion for new trial. Competitor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Linn Circuit Judge held that  1 as used in patent claims term user meant a person or a person using a computer  2 substantial evidence supported jury verdict finding of infringement of user limitation even under modified claim construction  3 substantial evidence supported finding of infringement of patent claims password and authorization code limitations  4 patents automatic and electronic claim limitations did not require that initiation of registration communication commence without any user interaction  5 substantial evidence supported jurys determination that patents were not invalid for anticipation  6 erroneous instruction did not warrant new trial on issue of anticipation and  7 refusing to give competitors requested jury instruction was not abuse of discretion.  Affirmed. ,Court of Appeals reviews denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and thus affirms jurys verdict unless a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the winning party. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 50a1 28 U.S.C.A.,Denial of motion for judgment as a matter of law is a procedural issue not unique to patent law and thus is reviewed by Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on appeal in patent case under the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal from the district court normally would lie. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 50a1 28 U.S.C.A.,Under the law of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal from decision on motion for judgment as a matter of law must affirm unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jurys verdict and in this regard the evidence as well as all reasonable inferences from it are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 50a1 28 U.S.C.A.,In the patent infringement context anticipation is a factual determination that is reviewed for substantial evidence when decided by a jury as is the jurys determination of non-infringement.,On appeal in patent infringement action Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviews the denial of a motion for a new trial under regional circuit law.,Under the law of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denial of motion for new trial is reversed only upon an abuse of discretion or a misapprehension of the law by the district court.,Patent claim construction is an issue of law over which Court of Appeals exercises plenary review.,As used in claims of patents related to prevention of software piracy term user could not be construed to mean computer or computers but rather meant a person or a person using a computer.,In construing a disputed claim term court begins with the language of the patent claims.,Claims of patents related to prevention of software piracy did not require authorization of particular user regardless of what particular computer was being used and thus did not preclude finding that competitors accused products which recognized unauthorized computers rather than unauthorized users infringed patents in that identification called for could be accomplished by comparing registration information with previously stored information related to software installed by person on computer to person using computer or to computer hardware.,Substantial evidence supported jury verdict finding infringement of user claim limitation of patents related to prevention of software piracy even under Court of Appeals modification of district courts construction of claim term user to mean a person or a person using a computer but not a computer or computers given that claims explicitly contemplated tracking authorized users through among other things identity of computers on which they installed software and that accused products made product activation determinations based on registration information related to users computers.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding that accused products infringed password and authorization code limitations of patents related to prevention of software piracy which disclosed system using initial password or authorization code to enable software grace period for fixed number of uses or period of time including evidence that competitor directed its users to input specific product key provided with each copy of software that product key was required as part of product installation and that users had to enable grace period using specific product key to enable software beyond grace period notwithstanding competitors contention that its product key was not authorization code because single product key could enable grace period for any copy of the software.,Infringement is not avoided merely because a non-infringing mode of operation is possible.,Automatic and electronic claim limitations in patents related to prevention of software piracy did not require that once users chose electronic or automatic registration mode as contrasted with manual mode for enabling software beyond grace period previously enabled by initial authorization code initiation of registration communication had to commence without any user interaction given that claims although silent as to initiation of registration process contemplated user choice as to registration mode and required at least minimal level of user interaction to select mode.,Jury could reasonably conclude that manually pressing next button was merely part of selection process through which competitors accused products allowed users to choose between Internet or telephone activation of software supporting jurys finding of infringement of patents related to prevention of software piracy with respect to automatic and electronic claim limitations addressing enabling of software beyond grace period previously enabled by initial authorization code.,Substantial evidence supported finding that anti-piracy feature of competitors licensing verification program LVP did not work for its intended purpose of reducing software piracy sustaining jury verdict that patents related to prevention of software piracy were not invalid for anticipation based on LVP including competitors internal presentation indicating that LVPs effectiveness was not known testimony of competitors witness that anti-piracy software found in accused products was virtually a complete rewrite of software in LVP and internal e-mail reflecting LVPs ineffectiveness. 35 U.S.C.A.  102g2.,Competitor as party asserting invalidity of patent based on anticipation bore burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that its product constituted an actual reduction to practice of the invention claimed in challenged patents. 35 U.S.C.A.  102g2.,To establish an actual reduction to practice in the context of claim that patent was invalid by anticipation inventor must prove that 1 he constructed an embodiment or performed a process that met all the claim limitations and 2 he determined that the invention would work for its intended purpose. 35 U.S.C.A.  102g2.,Testing is required to demonstrate reduction to practice of invention in some instances because without such testing there cannot be sufficient certainty that the invention will work for its intended purpose.,Under the law of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals two requirements must be met before new trial will be granted based on erroneous jury instruction first challenger must demonstrate that instruction as a whole creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether jury has been properly guided in its deliberations second even if instructions were erroneous court will not reverse if it determines based upon the entire record that challenged instruction could not have affected outcome of case.,Whether inventors testimony of conception had to be corroborated by single document was not issue in action for alleged infringement of patents related to prevention of software piracy given competitors contention that in asserting claim that patents were invalid for anticipation by competitors earlier product it did not have to name particular inventor and could instead rely on corporate conception and reduction to practice and given that competitors earlier product was not reduction to practice of asserted patent claims and therefore single document jury instruction although improper did not warrant new trial on issue of anticipation. 35 U.S.C.A.  102g2.,Refusing to give competitors requested jury instruction in patent infringement case which would have instructed jury that competitors burden of proving patents invalidity by clear and convincing evidence was more easily carried when prior art references on which its claim of anticipation was based were not directly considered by examiner during patent prosecution was not abuse of discretion given that requested instruction was not compelled by precedent and could have led jury to believe that burden of proof was less than clear and convincing when prior art was not considered by Patent and Trademark Office PTO. 35 U.S.C.A.  102g2.,Jury in determining its damages award in action for infringement of patents related to prevention of software piracy could not have relied upon provision of patent infringement statute addressing inducement of combination of components of patented invention outside United States in manner that would infringe patent if combination occurred within United States as to which jury was given no instructions and therefore damages award that was based in part upon competitors global sales did not necessarily implicate statute so as to warrant new trial on damages issue. 35 U.S.C.A.  271a f.,US Patent 6044471 US Patent 6785825.

Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,District courts decision granting denying or modifying injunction in patent case is reviewed for abuse of discretion.,In order to prevail on appeal on issue of damages appellant must convince court that determination was based on erroneous conclusion of law clearly erroneous factual findings or clear error of judgment amounting to abuse of discretion.,District courts interpretation of its own order is entitled to deference unless interpretation is unreasonable or is otherwise abuse of discretion.,District court did not abuse its discretion in patent infringement action in clarifying that stay of permanent injunction until seven days after the resolution or abandonment of any appeal included petition for certiorari to Supreme Court.,District court did not abuse its discretion in patent infringement case by extending stay of permanent injunction in order to address pending motions including motions related to whether injunction ought to be dissolved even though courts original order stated that stay would last until seven days after the resolution or abandonment of any appeal and defendant had exhausted its appeal.,United States Supreme Court decision is generally considered to be intervening so as to require Court of Appeals to overturn matters previously settled as law of the case when it comes between appellate decision and proceedings on remand but decision is not intervening if parties have reasonable opportunity to raise issue with respect to that decision prior to issuance of appellate mandate.,Defendant in patent infringement action had reasonable opportunity to raise issue with respect to United States Supreme Courts decision in eBay Inc. v.

against blue noise mask was not abstract but instead presented functional and palpable applications in field of computer technology and thus was patent-eligible although algorithms and formulas controlled masks and half-toning. 35 U.S.C.A.  100 101.,A court may not reject subject matter categorically because it finds that a claim is not worthy of a patent. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,On an application for a patent abstractness as a disqualifying characteristic should exhibit itself so manifestly as to override the broad statutory categories of eligible subject matter and the statutory context that directs primary attention on the patentability criteria of the rest of the Patent Act. 35 U.S.C.A.  100 101.,Inventions with specific applications or improvements to technologies in the marketplace are not likely to be so abstract that they override the statutory language and framework of the Patent Act. 35 U.S.C.A.  100 101.,A patent that presents a process sufficient to pass the coarse eligibility filter may nonetheless be invalid as indefinite because the invention would not provide sufficient particularity and clarity to inform skilled artisans of the bounds of the claim that same subject matter also might be so conceptual that the written description does not enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to replicate the process. 35 U.S.C.A.  101 112.,Subsequent continuation patent that disclosed half-tone masks that substantially produced dot profiles with substantially blue noise characteristics was broader than prior parent patent application that disclosed blue noise mask that was halftone mask with wraparound properties that produces blue noise and visually pleasing dot profiles at any level of gray and thus claims in continuation patent were not entitled to claim benefit of filing dates of parent application since person of ordinary skill in the art would not have understood from prior invention that inventors had disclosed half-tone masks that substantially produced dot profiles with substantially blue noise characteristics. 35 U.S.C.A.  112 120.,To obtain the benefit of a parent patent applications filing date the claims of the later-filed application must be supported by the written description in the parent in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing date sought. 35 U.S.C.A.  120.,Entitlement to a filing date extends only to subject matter that is disclosed not to that which is obvious therefore to obtain the benefit of a parent patent applications filing date the parent patent application must actually or inherently disclose the elements of the later-filed claims. 35 U.S.C.A.  120.,A patent is presumed valid and the party asserting invalidity has the burden of persuasion to show the contrary by clear and convincing evidence the challenger has the burden of going forward with invalidating prior art and the patentee then has the burden of going forward with evidence to the contrary i.e. the patentee must show that the prior art does not actually invalidate the patent or that it is not prior art because the asserted claim is entitled to the benefit of an earlier filing date.,Parent patent application disclosed only blue noise mask and thus had to be limited accordingly on claim for earlier filing date for continuation patent where among other things application limited invention to blue noise mask which was halftone mask with wraparound properties that produces blue noise and visually pleasing dot profiles at any level of gray specification repeatedly referred to blue noise mask as the present invention figures in patent only illustrated various aspects of blue noise mask all approved claims of application recited blue noise mask and inventors admitted that they only described blue noise mask. 35 U.S.C.A.  120.,Expert declaration explaining that prior parent application provided written description support for later-filed claims properly was accorded little weight where declaration was five years old at time that issue was addressed and declaration addressed patent claims that were not at issue. 35 U.S.C.A.  120.,Claim in subsequent continuation patent reciting an apparatus for comparing on a pixel-by-pixel basis a plurality of color planes of said color image against a blue noise mask was entitled to claim benefit of earlier filing date of prior parent application that described blue noise mask in terms of its first and second order properties and not how it was made since claim covered blue noise mask that was calculated in any way and had written description support even if it did not recite exact method steps described in specification or any other methods for making blue noise mask. 35 U.S.C.A.  120.,A court generally must take care to avoid reading process limitations into an apparatus patent claim because the process by which a product is made is irrelevant to the question of whether that product infringes a pure apparatus claim.,Apparatus patent claims do not need to recite every method of making the claimed apparatus.,District courts summary judgment had to be reversed rather than vacated as to whether prior parent patent applications had provided written description support for claim of subsequent continuation patent although competitor had alternate arguments to make on remand as to why claims were not entitled to earlier filing dates such as lack of enablement competitors motion had been based solely on written description rather than on lack of enablement and that motion should have been denied. 35 U.S.C.A.  112 120 Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56 28 U.S.C.A.,US Patent 5111310 US Patent 5341228 US Patent 5477305 US Patent 5543941 US Patent

Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded.  Reyna Circuit Judge filed opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Opinion 770 F.3d 1371 superseded on rehearing. ,District courts claim construction determinations based on evidence intrinsic to the patent as well as its ultimate interpretations of the patent claims are legal questions reviewed de novo.,To the extent the district court in construing patent claims makes underlying findings of fact based on extrinsic evidence the Court of Appeals reviews such findings of fact for clear error.,Claims in patent for system and method of distributed learning requiring graphical display representative of classroom did not require pictorial map that identified participants location even though specification disclosed examples and embodiments where virtual classroom was depicted as map or seating chart where patent defined classroom as an at least partially virtual space in which participants can interact specification did not limit graphical display to those examples and embodiments and embodiments and examples in specification of classroom metaphors relating to maps were consistently described in terms of preference.,It is the claims not the written description which define the scope of the patent right.,Patent claims must not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.,In enacting provision governing construction of means-plus-function claims Congress struck a balance in allowing patentees to express a claim limitation by reciting a function to be performed rather than by reciting structure for performing that function while placing specific constraints on how such a limitation is to be construed namely by restricting the scope of coverage to only the structure materials or acts described in the specification as corresponding to the claimed function and equivalents thereof. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Merely because a named element of a patent claim is followed by the word means does not automatically make that element a means-plus-function element under the statute governing construction of means-plus-function claims. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Merely because an element of a patent claim does not include the word means does not automatically prevent that element from being construed as a means-plus-function element. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Presumption that the means-plus-function statute does not apply to a patent claim that does not use the word means is not strong and a showing that the limitation essentially is devoid of anything that can be construed as structure is not required to overcome the presumption overruling Lighting World Inc. v.

Motorola Inc. 757 F.3d 1286. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,When a patent claim term lacks the word means presumption that the means-plus-function statute does not apply can be overcome and the statute will apply if the challenger demonstrates that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Term distributed learning control module as used in patent for system and method of distributed learning was means-plus-function claim term despite absence of the word means in the claim the claim replaced the word means with the word module a generic description for software or hardware that performs a specified function and set forth the same black box recitation of structure for providing the same specified function as if the term means had been used. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Generic terms such as mechanism element device and other nonce words that reflect nothing more than verbal constructs may be used in a patent claim in a manner that is tantamount to using the word means because they typically do not connote sufficiently definite structure and therefore may invoke the means-plus-function statute. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,In determining whether presumption that the means-plus-function statute does not apply to a patent claim that does not use the word means has been rebutted the fact that one of skill in the art could program a computer to perform the recited functions cannot create structure where none otherwise is disclosed. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Specification of patent for system and method of distributed learning did not disclose sufficient structure corresponding to the distributed learning control module referred to in means-plus-function claims making those claims invalid for indefiniteness written description made it clear that the distributed learning control module had to be implemented in a special purpose computer but the specification did not set forth an algorithm for performing the claimed functions. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Construing a means-plus-function claim term is a two-step process the court must first identify the claimed function then the court must determine what structure if any disclosed in the specification corresponds to the claimed function. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Where there are multiple claimed functions in a means-plus-function patent claim the patentee must disclose adequate corresponding structure to perform all of the claimed functions if the patentee fails to disclose adequate corresponding structure the claim is indefinite. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Structure disclosed in the patent specification qualifies as corresponding structure for a means-plus-function claim if the intrinsic evidence clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim even if the specification discloses corresponding structure the disclosure must be of adequate corresponding structure to achieve the claimed function. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,Under the means-plus-function statute if a person of ordinary skill in the art would be unable to recognize the structure in the specification and associate it with the corresponding function in the claim a means-plus-function clause is indefinite. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,In cases involving a claim limitation subject to the means-plus-function statute that must be implemented in a special purpose computer the structure disclosed in the specification must be more than simply a general purpose computer or microprocessor the specification must disclose an algorithm for performing the claimed function which may be expressed as a mathematical formula in prose or as a flow chart or in any other manner that provides sufficient structure. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,The testimony of one of ordinary skill in the art cannot supplant the total absence of structure from the patent specification corresponding to a means-plus-function claim. 35 U.S.C.A.  112.,US Patent 6155840.

../../files/WestLaw/Microsoft Corp./269 - US v Watts.txt, Background After one defendant was convicted of inter alia bank fraud and conspiracy preliminary orders of forfeiture were issued as to funds held in eight bank accounts. Claims of interest in four of the accounts were filed by bank and by a co-defendant and his lawyers. Government moved to dismiss co-defendants petition co-defendant and his lawyers cross-moved for judgment on pleadings against the government and to dismiss banks claims and a former employee of defendants company filed a pro se request to be allowed to file a claim. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York Matsumoto J. 919 F.Supp.2d 254 granted motion in part and denied motion in part. Co-defendant and lawyers appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Gerard E. Lynch Circuit Judge held that  1 government had standing to contest validity of assignment  2 co-defendant and his lawyers had standing to raise a third party claim in forfeiture proceedings  3 governments interest in funds was superior to that of co-defendant and his lawyers for purposes of superior interest exception to forfeiture statute and  4 co-defendant and lawyers stated a plausible claim to seized funds on basis of status as a bona fide purchaser for value.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,At an ancillary proceeding following preliminary forfeiture order a petitioning third party must first establish his standing to challenge forfeiture order by demonstrating a legal interest in forfeited property and must then prove his entitlement to relief on merits by establishing through a preponderance of evidence one of two superior claims to the property. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 6 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2 6.,A motion to dismiss a third-party petition in a forfeiture proceeding should be treated like a motion to dismiss a civil complaint for failure to state a claim.

Fed.Rules Cr.Proc.Rule 32.2c1 18 U.S.C.A.,To establish standing to challenge an order of forfeiture a petitioner must demonstrate that he has a legal interest in the forfeited property. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2.,Extent of a petitioners interest in forfeited property is determined in accordance with state law. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2.,Where under state law petitioner has no valid interest in property subject to forfeiture the inquiry ends and the claim fails for lack of standing. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2.,A fraudulent conveyance under New York Debtor and Creditor Law is not void per se in all its applications rather as a transaction fraudulent only as to creditors of transferor it is merely voidable by creditors of transferor. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  273.,Under New York Debtor and Creditor Law government qualified as a creditor and thus had standing in forfeiture proceeding brought after defendant was convicted of inter alia conspiracy to commit bank fraud to contest validity of the assignment to co-defendant and his lawyers by a subsidiary of defendants company of certain seized funds allegedly in payment for past and future legal services provided to co-defendant governments claim to property subject to criminal forfeiture under federal law was no different from that of a plaintiff in a pending tort action and vested upon commission of act giving rise to forfeiture and governments forfeiture claim against property rendered government a creditor of subsidiary of defendants company at time of assignment regardless of whether company was charged with any crimes or was a party to the criminal trial. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  270 273 18 U.S.C.A.  982a2 Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303c 21 U.S.C.A.  853c.,Under New Yorks Debtor and Creditor Law relationship of debtor and creditor arises the moment creditors legal right to recover property from debtor accrues. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  273.,A debtors conveyance is deemed constructively fraudulent under New York Debtor and Creditor Law only if two separate elements are satisfied first it is made without fair consideration and second transferor is insolvent or will be rendered insolvent by transfer in question. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  273.,Whether the debtor received fair consideration under New York Debtor and Creditor Law provision governing fraudulent conveyances entails three elements first the recipient of the debtors property must either convey property in exchange or discharge an antecedent debt in exchange second such exchange must be a fair equivalent of the property received and third such exchange must be in good faith. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  273.,While transfers made to benefit third parties are generally not made for a fair consideration fair consideration under fraudulent conveyance provision of New York Debtor and Creditor Law may be deemed to exist where debtors discharge of a third persons debt also discharges his own debt to that third person even a transfer satisfying an antecedent debt to a third party however is not made for fair consideration where that third party is an officer director or major shareholder of the transferor. N.Y.McKinneys Debtor and Creditor Law  273.,Allegation in third-party petition in forfeiture proceeding brought after defendant was convicted of inter alia conspiracy to commit bank fraud that certain of seized funds had been assigned to co-defendant and his lawyers by a subsidiary of defendants company in payment for past and future legal services provided to co-defendant was sufficient to establish an interest in funds as required to demonstrate that co-defendant and his lawyers had standing to raise a third party claim petition provided enough facts to state a claim for relief that was plausible on its face and facts alleged did not suggest that it is implausible that subsidiary was solvent at the time of the assignment. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2.,Because forfeitable property vests in the government immediately upon the commission of a criminal act a third party may prevail in an ancillary proceeding only by establishing that he had a legal interest in the forfeited property before the underlying crime was committed that is before the governments interest vested. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303c n6A 21 U.S.C.A.  853c n6A.,Because the proceeds of an offense do not exist before the offense is committed and because the governments interest in property subject to criminal forfeiture under the relation-back doctrine immediately vests upon the commission of that offense any proceeds that ensue from the criminal act belong to the government from the moment that they come into existence. Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n2 21 U.S.C.A.  853n2.,In light of jurys determination that seized funds represented proceeds of defendants conspiracy to commit bank fraud governments interest in those funds vested at time of defendants criminal acts which preceded assignment of the funds to co-defendant and his lawyers and thus governments interest in the funds was superior to that of co-defendant and his lawyers for purposes of superior interest exception to forfeiture statute. 18 U.S.C.A.  982a2 Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n6A 21 U.S.C.A.  853n6A.,Law firm that was assigned in payment for past and future legal services to co-defendant certain funds seized in prosecution for inter alia conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as co-defendant as third-party beneficiary of the assignment stated a plausible claim to the seized funds in forfeiture proceeding on basis of an interest superior to that of the government as a bona fide purchaser for value under New York law while firm was aware that indictment included a forfeiture allegation and that government had filed a bill of particulars identifying assignors four bank accounts as among the properties it sought to have forfeited law firm could have been reasonably without cause to believe that the challenged property was subject to forfeiture given trial courts ruling prior to assignment that government did not have probable cause to restrain such property prior to trial. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 4 Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984  303n6B 21 U.S.C.A.  853n6B.,Criminal forfeiture statute authorizes forfeiture of any property that is derived from proceeds obtained through a defendants offense whether or not that property was ever owned by the criminal defendant. 18 U.S.C.A.  982a2.

The jury found patent infringed by competitors software products and awarded damages of 357693056.18. The United States District Court for the Southern District of California Marilyn L. Huff J. 580 F.Supp.2d 1016 denied competitors motion for judgment as a matter of a law and competitor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Michel Chief Judge held that  1 substantial evidence supported jurys finding that claim directed to method of inputting data into particular fields displayed in computer form was not rendered obvious by earlier magazine article  2 substantial evidence supported jurys finding that claim which required display of bit-mapped-graphics field into which user could enter information was not rendered obvious by article  3 adequate circumstantial evidence permitted jury to find that user of competitors products directly infringed patent  4 sufficient evidence supported jurys finding of contributory infringement  5 substantial evidence supported jurys finding that competitor had requisite intent to induce users of its products to infringe patents and  6 damages award was not supported by substantial evidence.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law JMOL after a jury verdict the Court of Appeals applies the same standard of review as that applied by the trial court.,The grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is a procedural issue not unique to patent law reviewed under the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal from the district court would usually lie.,A district court grants judgment as a matter of law JMOL only if the evidence construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party permits only one reasonable conclusion and that conclusion is contrary to the jurys verdict.,A district court may grant a new trial only if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence.,Infringement is a question of fact reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury.,Obviousness is a legal question reviewed de novo by the Court of Appeals to determine whether the subject matter of the claimed invention would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person of ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter of the invention pertains underpinning that legal issue are factual questions relating to the scope and content of the prior art the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary skill in the art and any relevant secondary considerations such as commercial success long-felt need and the failure of others. 35 U.S.C.A.  103a.,Court of Appeals reviews for an abuse of discretion a district courts decision concerning the methodology for calculating damages.,Court of Appeals reviews the jurys determination of the amount of damages an issue of fact for substantial evidence a jurys decision with respect to damages must be upheld unless the amount is grossly excessive or monstrous clearly not supported by the evidence or based only on speculation or guesswork.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding that claim directed to method of inputting data into particular fields displayed in computer form in patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard was not rendered obvious by earlier magazine article describing potential benefits and drawbacks of using computer touch screens evidence included expert testimony that article did not disclose step of inserting data into information field did not disclose limitations in claim for a graphical tool for composing information or for a tool that overlayed a form and described system proceeding from entry of one type of data to the next such that ordinarily skilled artisan would not have had reason to highlight single data field in contrast to limitation in claim for indicating particular one of several information fields into which information was to be inserted. 35 U.S.C.A.  102b g.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding that claim in patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard was not rendered obvious by earlier magazine article which claim required display of bit-mapped-graphics field into which user could enter information by writing on touch sensitive screen using stylus article disclosed system that could accept touch of pen or other device not handwriting on touch sensitive screen and article in fact appeared to teach away from inclusion of field into which user would enter information by writing on screen using stylus. 35 U.S.C.A.  102b g.,To infringe a method claim a person must have practiced all steps of the claimed method just as anticipation can be found by a single prior art use a finding of infringement can rest on as little as one instance of the claimed method being performed during the pertinent time period. 35 U.S.C.A.  271.,Adequate circumstantial evidence permitted jury to find that at least one person other than patentees expert used competitors accused software products to perform claimed method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard and thereby directly infringed patent evidence showed extensive sales of allegedly infringing products and competitors dissemination of manuals instructing customers to use products in an infringing way. 35 U.S.C.A.  271.,Competitors expert testimony that allegedly infringing software product did not contain onscreen composition tool was insufficient to require jury to find as a factual matter only noninfringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard other expert testimony including that of another of competitors experts supported finding that products calendar feature was composition tool that allowed user to combine information as in claimed method. 35 U.S.C.A.  271.,In order to succeed on a claim of contributory infringement in addition to proving an act of direct infringement plaintiff must show that defendant knew that the combination for which its components were especially made was both patented and infringing and that defendants components have no substantial non-infringing uses. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,Sufficient evidence supported jurys finding that competitor intended users of accused software products to use products date-picker tool and that the only intended use of the tool was infringing patent as would render competitor liable for contributory infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard although products had many non-infringing uses inclusion of infringing tool within larger programs with non-infringing uses did not change the tools ability to infringe. 35 U.S.C.A.  271c.,Patentee has the burden of showing that an alleged infringers actions induced infringing acts and that he knew or should have known his actions would induce actual infringements. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,A finding of inducement requires a threshold finding of direct infringement either a finding of specific instances of direct infringement or a finding that the accused products necessarily infringe. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,Inducement requires evidence of culpable conduct directed to encouraging anothers infringement not merely that the inducer had knowledge of the direct infringers activities. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,Intent element required for claim of inducement to infringe a patent may be established through circumstantial evidence. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,Evidence of active steps taken to induce infringement such as advertising an infringing use can support a finding of an intention for the product to be used in an infringing manner. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,Substantial evidence supported jurys finding that competitor had requisite intent to induce users of its accused software products to infringe patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard expert testimony explained that products forms and tools required users to perform claimed method of entering information and that competitors documentation encouraged users to use infringing tools. 35 U.S.C.A.  271b.,The burden of proving damages from infringement falls on the patentee. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Two alternative categories of infringement compensation are the patentees lost profits and the reasonable royalty he would have received through arms-length bargaining a reasonable royalty is merely the floor below which damages shall not fall. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The analytical method for calculating reasonable royalties to be awarded as damages for infringement focuses on the infringers projections of profit for the infringing product. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The hypothetical negotiation or the willing licensor-willing licensee approach for calculating reasonable royalties to be awarded as damages for infringement attempts to ascertain the royalty upon which the parties would have agreed had they successfully negotiated an agreement just before infringement began. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The hypothetical negotiation approach tries to recreate the ex ante licensing negotiation scenario and to describe the resulting agreement to calculate reasonable royalties to be awarded as damages for infringement in other words if infringement had not occurred willing parties would have executed a license agreement specifying a certain royalty payment scheme. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The hypothetical negotiation for calculating reasonable royalties to be awarded as damages for infringement assumes that the asserted patent claims are valid and infringed. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Consideration of rates paid by licensees for the use of other patents comparable to patent in suit weighed strongly against jurys lump-sum royalty payment of 357693056.18 as damages for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard no documentary evidence or testimony showed the parties expectations as to usage of claimed method by customers using accused software products that would support large size of lump-sum award lump-sum license agreements which purportedly supported award were either radically different from hypothetical licensing agreement for the patent in suit or lacking in probative value due to uncertain subject matter of agreements and jury heard almost no testimony with which to recalculate the value of purportedly comparable running royalty agreements to arrive at lump-sum damages award. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Consideration of nature of patented invention and portion of competitors profit that could be credited to invention provided minimal support for jurys lump-sum royalty payment of 357693056.18 as damages for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard customers infringing use of accused software products date-picker feature was a minor aspect of competitors product and the portion of profit attributable to the infringing use of the date-picker tool was exceedingly small. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Consideration of the extent to which the infringer made use of the patented invention and evidence probative of the value of that use did not support jurys lump-sum royalty payment of 357693056.18 as damages for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard beyond circumstantial evidence that at least one person using competitors accused software product performed the patented method one time in the United States sometime during the relevant period there was nothing indicating that anyone had ever performed the patented method or how many times. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Consideration of evidence of usage of claimed method after infringement started can under appropriate circumstances be helpful in assessing whether a royalty is reasonable award of damages for infringement usage or similar data may provide information that the parties would frequently have estimated during hypothetical negotiation for licensing of patent. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Consideration of nature of hypothetical license as exclusive or nonexclusive of the licensors established policy and marketing program to maintain patent monopoly of the commercial relationship between the licensor and the licensee of the established profitability of the product made under the patent of the utility and advantages of the patent property over old modes or devices and of the portion of the profit or of the selling price that would be customary to allow for the use of the invention weighed neither for nor against jurys lump-sum royalty payment of 357693056.18 as damages for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard based on customers use of competitors accused software product factors offset one another to the extent they were relevant.,Jurys damages award of lump-sum royalty payment of 357693056.18 for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard based on customers use of competitors accused software product was not supported by substantial evidence there was no evidence that patentee and competitor would have entered into hypothetical licensing agreement calling for lump-sum royalty payment subsequently amounting to approximately eight percent of competitors revenues for the sale of accused product. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,On post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law challenging jurys award of royalties as damages in patent infringement action district court must scrutinize the evidence carefully to ensure that the substantial evidence standard is satisfied while keeping in mind that a reasonable royalty analysis necessarily involves an element of approximation and uncertainty. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,To the extent that jury relied on an entire market value calculation to arrive at lump-sum royalty payment amount of 357693056.18 as damages for infringement damages award was against the clear weight of the evidence in action for indirect infringement of patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard based on customers use of competitors accused software product there was no evidence that claimed method was the basis or even a substantial basis of consumer demand for accused product and patentees expert after being precluded from using price of entire computer loaded with accused software as the royalty base used the price of the accused software as the base but improperly inflated the royalty rate to eight percent to try to reach the damages number he would have obtained using the price of entire computer despite admitting that competitor had never agreed to pay an eight percent royalty on any comparable patent. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,For the entire market value rule to apply as the measure of damages for patent infringement the patentee must prove that the patent-related feature is the basis for customer demand of the accused product. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,The base used in a running royalty calculation to determine infringement damages can always be the value of the entire commercial embodiment as long as the magnitude of the royalty rate is within an acceptable range thus even when the patented invention is a small component of a much larger accused commercial product awarding a reasonable royalty based on either sale price or number of units sold can be economically justified. 35 U.S.C.A.  284.,Evidence submitted by patentee at summary judgment stage showing that accused products reached the same result as apparatus claims containing means-plus-function elements in patent for method of entering information into fields on computer screen without using keyboard was insufficient to raise triable issue of fact as to whether products infringed claims evidence did not demonstrate circumstantially or otherwise anything about the steps used by the accused products to

The United States District Court for the District of Maryland Marvin J. Garbis Senior District Judge 327 F.Supp.2d 537 granted summary judgment for licensees. Artist appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Michael Circuit Judge held that  1 claims in subsequent actions which sought actual damages in form of reasonable royalty from each licensee were identical to claims in prior action which failed to prove infringement profits against team and its licensing agent and thus doctrine of claim preclusion applied to subsequent actions  2 artist could not pursue statutory damages against team and its licensing agent where artist did not register his copyright before infringement began  3 date on which each individual licensee first violated artists copyright was not date that licensees infringement commenced under provision which required registration as prerequisite to certain remedies for infringement and  4 date of commencement under provision which required registration as prerequisite to certain remedies for infringement was earliest date of infringement by any participant in line of related copyright violations.  Affirmed.  Niemeyer Circuit Judge filed concurring opinion. ,Copyright claims in subsequent actions which sought actual damages in form of reasonable royalty from each licensee were identical to copyright claims in prior action which failed to prove infringement profits against licensor and thus doctrine of claim preclusion applied to subsequent actions since same violations of artists copyright were described throughout all of the complaints artist could have sought actual damages against licensor and infringement profits were linked to actual damages in that infringement profits had to be taken into account in nature of any actual damages. 17 U.S.C.A.  504a1 b.,The related doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits conserve judicial resources and by preventing inconsistent decisions encourage reliance on adjudication.,A subsequent claim is precluded when 1 the judgment in the prior action was final and on the merits 2 the parties in the two actions are identical or in privity and 3 the claims in the two actions are identical.,The requirement of the claim preclusion doctrine that the claims in the first and subsequent actions be identical is met if the new claim arises out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the claim resolved by the prior judgment.,When deciding what copyright infringement profits must be disgorged a court must exclude certain amounts calculated as actual damages to avoid double counting. 17 U.S.C.A.  504b.,A copyright holder may exercise discretion in suing as many co-infringers as he chooses.,When an injured person sues joint tortfeasors in successive actions preclusion principles determine the effect of the first judgment on the later actions.

The patentee appealed and the manufacturer cross-appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Chen Circuit Judge held that  1 the patent claims were directed to patent-ineligible abstract ideas and  2 Noerr-Pennington immunity precluded the manufacturers counterclaims against the patentee.  Affirmed. ,Claims in a patent for extracting data from documents recognizing specific information and storing that information in memory in automated teller machines ATM were directed to patent-ineligible abstract ideas the concept of data collection recognition and storage was indisputably well-known and there was no inventive concept in the use of a generic scanner and computer to perform well-understood routine and conventional activities commonly used in industry. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Under Noerr-Pennington a persons act of petitioning the government is presumptively shielded from liability by the First Amendment against certain types of claims. U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1.,To overcome presumptive Noerr-Pennington immunity a defendant must establish that the plaintiffs instigation of litigation was merely a sham by showing not only that the litigation was objectively baseless but also that the defendant subjectively intended to harm the plaintiff through the abuse of a governmental process itself as opposed to harms flowing from the outcome of that process.,A patentees filing of a patent infringement action against a manufacturer of automated teller machines ATM though unsuccessful was not objectively baseless thus precluding the manufacturers tortious interference and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO claims against the patentee under Noerr-Pennington where the state of the law regarding the patentability of claims was deeply uncertain at the time the patentee filed. 18 U.S.C.A.  1961 et seq. 35 U.S.C.A.  101.,Under the first prong of overcoming presumptive Noerr-Pennington a sham lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.

../../files/WestLaw/Wells Fargo/024 - McCaig v Wells Fargo Bank (Texas) NA.txt, Background Home mortgagors son individually and as representative of mortgagors estate and sons wife brought action against loan servicer in state court asserting claims for breach of sons and wifes foreclosure forbearance agreement with servicer and claims for violations of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA. Action was removed and servicer counterclaimed for attorney fees and costs. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas Nelva Gonzales Ramos J. 2013 WL 3229663 granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to counterclaim and after jury verdict entered judgment on jurys awards of 75000 to each plaintiff for mental anguish 500 to each plaintiff for violation of TDCA and 1900 for expenses caused by TDCA violation but reduced to 156775 jurys award of 200000 for attorney fees and granted in part and denied in part each partys motion for costs 2014 WL 360546. Servicer appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Reavley Circuit Judge held that  1 under Texas law as predicted by the court of appeals son and his wife had standing to bring claims under TDCA  2 written threats to foreclosure were prohibited by law in light of forbearance agreements conditional waiver of right to foreclose  3 forbearance agreement did not authorize servicers attempts to collect late fees  4 servicer misrepresented the character extent and amount of debt  5 expenses that plaintiffs incurred for sending payments to servicer could not be recovered under TDCA  6 wife suffered sufficiently high degree of mental pain and distress and  7 servicers letter to Texas Attorney General did not violate TDCA.  Affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded.  Jones Circuit Judge filed a dissenting opinion. ,A district courts denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law JMOL is reviewed de novo under the same standard utilized by the district court. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 50a 28 U.S.C.A.,To the extent the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after a case was tried by a jury appellate review is especially deferential to the verdict.,When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged the court of appeals will uphold the verdict unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find as the jury did.,In conducting review for sufficiency of evidence the court of appeals must draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict and cannot substitute other inferences that it might regard as more reasonable.,A district courts resolution of a motion for new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion and the district court abuses its discretion by denying a new trial only when there is an absolute absence of evidence to support the jurys verdict.,If the court of appeals finds the evidence is legally sufficient it must also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for new trial.,The court of appeals reviews questions of statutory standing de novo.,Where the states highest court has not decided an issue the job of a federal court sitting in diversity is to predict how the court will rule.,In making an Erie guess regarding how a states highest court will rule on an issue a federal court sitting in diversity first examines precedents set by the states intermediate appellate courts and it defers to intermediate state appellate court decisions unless convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.,When a federal court interprets a Texas statute it follows the same rules of construction that a Texas court would apply.,Under Texas law the starting point of the courts analysis when construing a statute is the plain language of the statute.,Under Texas law as predicted by the court of appeals statutory standing to bring a private right of action for violations of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA is not limited to debtors and it extends to persons who have sustained actual damages from a TDCA violation. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Under Texas law mental anguish is a form of actual damages within meaning of statute providing standing for a private right of action by a person who sustains actual damages as a result of a violation of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Under Texas law as predicted by the court of appeals allegations of son of deceased home mortgagor and sons wife that they suffered mental anguish from loan servicers unlawful debt collection efforts after they entered into foreclosure forbearance agreement with servicer supported statutory standing to bring a private right of action against loan servicer for violation of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA as persons who suffered actual damages from TDCA violations. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,The duty of a federal court sitting in diversity is to apply existing state law not create it.,Under Texas law the economic loss rule serves to provide a more definite limitation on liability than foreseeability can and reflects a preference for allocating some economic risks by contract rather than by law.,Under Texas law the economic loss rule is not generally applicable in every situation and it allows recovery of economic damages in tort or not according to its underlying principles accordingly application of the rule depends on an analysis of its rationales in a particular situation.,Under Texas law breach of an independent legal duty separate from the existence of the contract itself represents a particular situation where tort claims based on that independent duty may co-exist with contract claims based on a breach of the contract and are not barred by the economic loss rule and thus a party states a tort claim when the duty allegedly breached is independent of the contractual undertaking and the harm suffered is not merely the economic loss of a contractual benefit.,Under Texas law the economic loss rule does not bar a debt collector from being liable for violations of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA even if there are contracts between the parties and even if the debt collectors prohibited conduct also amounts to contractual breach a statutory offender will not be shielded from liability simply by showing its violation also violated a contract. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,The general rule is that when a case is submitted to the jury on a general verdict the failure of evidence or a legal mistake under one theory of the case requires reversal for a new trial because the reviewing court cannot determine whether the jury based its verdict on a sound or unsound theory.,A party that makes no objection as to form or substance with respect to the verdict form cannot argue for the first time on appeal that a new trial is required due to inherent ambiguity in the verdict form.,Mortgage loan servicer invited any error and thus could not complain on appeal as to form of jury verdict form which sought a general verdict by listing five sections of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA and asking in one question whether servicer violated any of those sections while servicer initially submitted draft instructions that set forth each potential violation separately the district court was skeptical about the necessity of such an approach and asked if it would not be better to list the potential statutory violations within one question and after a brief colloquy servicers counsel stated that if counsel had to draft this over again thats the way Id draft it thereby expressly endorsing the jury question that servicer was seeking to challenge on appeal.,A party cannot complain on appeal of errors which he himself induced the district court to commit.,The invited error doctrine applies to jury instructions as well as evidentiary rulings.,The invited error doctrine prevents a litigant from speculating on a verdict and then when the speculation turns out badly escaping the consequences of having done so.,Loan servicer for home mortgage loan by executing a forbearance agreement gave up any contractual right to foreclosure so long as the forbearance agreements payment plan was followed and thus in the absence of a failure to follow the payment plan there was no contractual right that could serve as predicate for servicer to invoke the provision of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA allowing a debt collector as exception to general prohibition of threats to threaten to exercise a contractual right of seizure repossession or sale that does not require court proceedings. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a7 b3.,Provision of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA prohibiting a debt collector from threatening that nonpayment of a consumer debt will result in the seizure repossession or sale of the persons property without proper court proceedings does not apply to non-judicial foreclosure of a mortgage. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a7.,Under the provision of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA prohibiting a debt collector from threatening to take an action prohibited by law whether the threat is egregious is immaterial. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a8.,When claims for a violation of the provision of the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA prohibiting a debt collector from threatening to take an action prohibited by law are premised on a threat of mortgage foreclosure those claims generally turn on whether the mortgage was in default because a default generally triggers a mortgagees right to foreclose under a deed of trust and a mortgagor will be able to have the foreclosure sale set aside if a property is foreclosed upon absent default. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a8.,Home mortgage loan servicers written threats to foreclose were prohibited by law for purposes of provision of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA barring a debt collector from threatening to take an action prohibited by law where loan servicer had executed a forbearance agreement when the loan had fallen into default in which it had given up the right to foreclose so long as the forbearance agreements payment plan was followed and the forbearance agreements payment plan had been followed. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a8.,Arguments first raised in an appellants reply brief are waived.,Son of deceased home mortgagor and sons wife had standing to bring claim that loan servicer used unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt in violation of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA by attempting to collect unauthorized late fees son and wife had executed a foreclosure forbearance agreement with loan servicer when the loan went into default and under the forbearance agreement they became obligated to pay fees and charges associated with the loan subject to servicers conditional waiver of its right to collect fees and charges so long as the forbearance agreements payment plan was followed. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.303a2.,Late fees that loan servicer for home mortgage loan attempted to collect after servicers execution of foreclosure forbearance agreement were not authorized for purposes of provision of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA prohibiting unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt by attempting to collect unauthorized fees or charges forbearance agreement conditionally waived servicers right to collect fees associated with the loan as soon as the forbearance agreement was executed with the waiver conditioned on the forbearance agreements payment plan being followed as opposed to delaying the waiver until the payment plan had been completed. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.303a2.,Attempts by loan servicer for home mortgage loan to collect unauthorized late fees constituted unfair or unconscionable practices by a debt collector in violation of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA though servicer later removed the charges and ultimately did not collect the late fees. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.303a2.,Evidence established that loan servicer for home mortgage loan violated Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA by misrepresenting the character extent and amount of debt after execution of foreclosure forbearance agreement amount ultimately owed on loan depended on adherence to forbearance agreements payment plan servicers manual tracking of amounts owed using second set of records because its computer software could not handle the forbearance agreement led to mistakes such as a notice falsely asserting that forbearance plan had been broken as well as a representative of servicer who lacked access to pertinent records stating that repayment plan had been cancelled and that payment of 11900 was needed to avoid foreclosure and servicer attempted to collect late charges that were not authorized under forbearance agreement. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.304a8.,Son of deceased home mortgagor and sons wife were consumers for purposes of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA though they were not parties to the mortgage loan where they entered into a foreclosure forbearance agreement with loan servicer when the loan went into default which agreement required son and wife to follow a payment plan so that they incurred a debt and which debt they incurred for personal family or household purposes. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.0011 2.,Provision of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA prohibiting a debt collector from misrepresenting the character extent or amount of a consumer debt does not require misleading misrepresentations to be made with intent to defraud deceive or mislead rather lack of intent is an aspect of the Acts affirmative defense when bona fide errors occur despite reasonable procedures to avoid them. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.304a8 392.401.,Consumers could not recover from loan servicer for home mortgage loan as damages for servicers violations of Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA expenses that consumers incurred by using certified checks and overnight mail to make voluntary payments under foreclosure forbearance agreement where servicers TDCA violations did not cause the expenses rather the expenses were incurred as part of consumers performance of forbearance agreement. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,On appeal from jury verdict awarding damages in diversity action the court of appeals would apply federal standards of review to assess the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence in relation to the verdict but in doing so would refer to state law for the kind of evidence that must be produced to support a verdict.,Under Texas law to show an entitlement to mental anguish damages the plaintiff must put on evidence showing the nature duration and severity of the plaintiffs mental anguish thus establishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiffs daily routine or must show a high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry anxiety vexation embarrassment or anger.,Under Texas law to recover damages for mental anguish plaintiffs are not required to show the mental anguish resulted in physical symptoms.,Damages for mental anguish are recoverable under the Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Under Texas law expert testimony is not required to show compensable mental anguish which may be proven by the claimants own testimony that of third parties or that of experts.,Under Texas law expert testimony is not required to establish that mental anguish led to physical symptoms.,Under Texas law the suffering of family members may evidence mental anguish.,Evidence established that consumer suffered a sufficiently high degree of mental pain and distress as required to recover damages for mental anguish in action under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA against loan servicer for home mortgage loan relating to servicers repeated mistakes and institutional inability to identify and remedy its mistakes after consumer and her husband entered into foreclosure forbearance agreement consumer testified that dealing with servicer was outrageous and angering that she was very upset and angry that she obsessed over the matter and experienced ongoing fear that servicer would take the house away and that she had to try to keep herself calm when observing her husbands related stress which she feared might cause him a heart attack. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Evidence established that consumer suffered a sufficiently high degree of mental pain and distress as required to recover damages for mental anguish in action under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA against loan servicer for home mortgage loan relating to servicers repeated mistakes and institutional inability to identify and remedy its mistakes after consumer and his wife entered into foreclosure forbearance agreement consumer experienced anxiety and chest pain based on stress related to servicers misconduct he had to visit the emergency room twice as result of this pain he testified that the events were extremely upsetting and affected his family leaving him very anxious and very fearful and that servicers misconduct affected him every day over a two-and-a-half-year span. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Even assuming that district court abused its discretion by admitting expert testimony linking consumers chest pain to the situation with loan servicer for home mortgage loan the alleged error was subject to harmless error analysis with respect to jurys award of damages for mental anguish in consumers action under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA relating to servicers repeated mistakes and institutional inability to identify and remedy its mistakes after consumer and his wife entered into foreclosure forbearance agreement. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,Jury instructions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.,Because of the broad discretion afforded district courts in framing the instructions to the jury the court of appeals will find an abuse of discretion only if the jury charge as a whole is not a correct statement of the law and does not clearly instruct the jurors regarding the legal principles applicable to the factual issues before them.,Awards of 75000 to each of two consumers for mental anguish were not excessive in their action under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA against loan servicer for home mortgage loan relating to servicers repeated mistakes and institutional inability to identify and remedy its mistakes after consumer and his wife entered into foreclosure forbearance agreement. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.403a2.,The size of the award of damages to which a plaintiff is entitled is generally a fact question and the reviewing court should be exceedingly hesitant to overturn the decision of the jury as the primary fact finder and the decision of the trial judge who entered judgment on the verdict.,Only the strongest of showings warrants reversal of the amount of damages awarded.,Appellate review of an award of damages for emotional distress and mental anguish is conducted with deference to the fact-finder because of the intangibility of the harms suffered.,Absent gross excessiveness the appellate court accepts as proper the measure of damages a jury awards for mental anguish.,Letter that loan servicer for home mortgage loan wrote to Texas Attorney General responding to consumers complaint to Attorney General did not falsely represent that consumers debt pursuant to a foreclosure forbearance agreement was undisputed nor that consumers refusal to pay the debt was willful as would be required for a debt collectors liability under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA for making representations to any person other than the consumer that the consumer is willfully refusing to pay a nondisputed consumer debt when the debt is in dispute servicers letter did not deny the existence of a dispute and instead told servicers mistaken side of the story and servicer merely insisted that consumers broke their forbearance plan based on erroneous payment records that servicer submitted to Attorney General. V.T.C.A. Finance Code  392.301a3.,Under Texas law evidence was sufficient to establish the amount of time that consumers counsel spent on the case for purposes of attorney fee award under Texas Debt Collection Act TDCA in addition to testimony from counsel a print-out from attorneys case management system showing individual tasks performed by the attorney and the date on which those tasks were performed was admitted into evidence.

V.T.C.A. Bus.

Reversed and remanded. ,The extent of a bankruptcy courts jurisdiction is a legal issue that is reviewed de novo.,Federal law governs what is to be distributed in bankruptcy to a secured claimant that is oversecured and the statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges is not limited to when a sale occurs by the trustee in bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C.A.  363 506b.,Statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges applied to non-judicial foreclosure conducted under state law after bankruptcy court lifted automatic stay just as it applied to oversecured creditors whose claims were satisfied within bankruptcy proceeding. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges applied to pre-petition and post-petition claims. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Under statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges bankruptcy court could engage in reasonableness analysis even if agreements provisions for fees would be enforceable under state law including enforceable deed of trusts provisions setting a commission for trustee thus if a contractual fee is not reasonable it will not be given effect in bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Under Texas law a trustees contractual fee of five percent of the indebtedness in selling real property under deed of trust generally is enforceable.,A fee determination under the statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges is a mixed question of law and fact and so the applicability of the statute is reviewed de novo but the bankruptcy judges determination of reasonableness is reviewed for abuse of discretion. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that reasonable fee for trustee under deed of trust in selling real property was 7500 rather than 217750 which was five percent of bid for the property and allowable under Texas law lower amount was supported by her testimony that she spent more than ten but no more than twenty hours in carrying out foreclosure and that her hourly rate was 375. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Under statute entitling holder of oversecured claim to reasonable fees costs or charges bankruptcy court was within its discretion in finding that amount of attorneys fees sought by noteholder was not substantiated and therefore was not reasonable although there was evidence that attorneys for noteholder had provided some services and there was evidence that noteholder had in fact paid its attorneys amounts it sought to recover there was no documentation of the time that was spent and no testimony as to what was a reasonable fee. 11 U.S.C.A.  506b.,Under Texas law a noteholder bears the burden of demonstrating that the attorney fees it requests under a deed of trust were reasonable.,Bankruptcy court in the first instance had to consider whether a trustee under a deed of trust could seek to recover the remainder of her contractual commission that was otherwise not reasonable as unsecured creditor and whether a noteholder could seek to recover pre-petition or post-petition attorneys fees as an unsecured claim. 11 U.S.C.A.  502 506b.

Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim the court must accept all well-pled allegations in the complaint as true and ask whether under any reasonable interpretation the plaintiff states a claim that would entitle her to relief. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,Review of a district courts interpretation of a state statute by the Court of Appeals is plenary.,Mortgagors original complaint against mortgagees attorney and attorneys law firm did not give defendants fair notice of mortgagors subsequently amended Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA claim and thus the amended claim did not relate back to the original complaint for limitations purposes although there were overlapping facts between the two pleadings where amended claim specifically averred that attorney and law firm not just mortgagee violated the FDCPA by failing to withdraw mortgagees foreclosure complaint after mortgagor signed loan modification agreement but original complaint alleged no such conduct by attorney and law firm. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  802 et seq. 15 U.S.C.A.  1692 et seq. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c1B 28 U.S.C.A.,The purpose of relation back is to balance the interests of the defendant protected by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general and rule governing amended and supplemental pleadings in particular for resolving disputes on their merits. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15 28 U.S.C.A.,When an amendment relates back to the original complaint rule governing relation back of amendments allows a plaintiff to sidestep an otherwise-applicable statute of limitations thereby permitting resolution of a claim on the merits as opposed to a technicality at the same time the rule endeavors to preserve the important policies served by the statute of limitations most notably protection against the prejudice of having to defend against a stale claim as well as societys general interest in security and stability by requiring that the already commenced action sufficiently embraces the amended claims. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c 28 U.S.C.A.,The touchstone for relation back is fair notice because rule governing relation back of amendments is premised on the theory that a party who has been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to provide. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c 28 U.S.C.A.,Only when the opposing party is given fair notice of the general fact situation and the legal theory upon which the amending party proceeds will relation back be allowed amendments that significantly alter the nature of a proceeding by injecting new and unanticipated claims are treated far more cautiously. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c 28 U.S.C.A.,When the original pleading does not give a defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs amended claim is and the grounds upon which it rests the purpose of the statute of limitations has not been satisfied and it is not an original pleading that can be rehabilitated by invoking rule governing relation back of amendments put another way the underlying question is whether the original complaint adequately notified the defendants of the basis for liability the plaintiffs would later advance in the amended complaint. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c 28 U.S.C.A.,Rule governing relation back of amendments cannot save a complaint that obscures the factual predicate and legal theory of the amended claim. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 15c 28 U.S.C.A.,Courts frown on pleading by means of obfuscation because a pleading that is prolix andor confusing makes it difficult for the defendant to file a responsive pleading and makes it difficult for the trial court to conduct orderly litigation.,Mortgagors claim for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA accrued and one-year statute of limitations began to run on date loan modification agreement was signed and representation about her debt became objectively false not on date that mortgagees attorney and attorneys law firm learned of the existence of the modification agreement which had taken her debt out of default.

Broderick J. denied relators motion to remand the action to state court and dismissed the action. Relator appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Kearse Circuit Judge held that  1 federal-question jurisdiction was warranted over action and  2 trusts contained qualified mortgages as required to support their designation by banks as tax-exempt REMICs.  Affirmed. ,Federal-question jurisdiction is invoked by and large by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,In certain cases federal-question jurisdiction will lie over state-law claims that implicate significant federal issues. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,Federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is 1 necessarily raised 2 actually disputed 3 substantial and 4 capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress where all four of these requirements are met federal jurisdiction is proper because there is a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum which can be vindicated without disrupting Congresss intended division of labor between state and federal courts. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,A state-law claim necessarily raises federal questions as required to support federal-question jurisdiction where the claim is affirmatively premised on a violation of federal law. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,State-law claims do not necessarily raise federal questions as required to invoke federal-question jurisdiction where all of the plaintiffs claims seek relief under state law and none necessarily raises a federal issue. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,The actually disputed factor of the test for federal-question jurisdiction over a state-law claim is satisfied when the federal issue is the only or the central point in dispute. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,In order to satisfy the substantial federal issue requirement for federal-question jurisdiction over a state-law claim that is to present a legal issue that implicates a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum it is not enough that the federal issue be significant to the particular parties in the immediate suit rather the substantiality inquiry looks instead to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,The requirement that the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction over a state law claim not disturb any congressionally approved balance of state and federal judicial responsibilities focuses principally on the nature of the claim the traditional forum for such a claim and the volume of cases that would be affected absent a special state interest in a category of litigation or an express congressional preference to avoid federal adjudication federal questions that implicate substantial federal interests will often be appropriately resolved in federal rather than state court. 28 U.S.C.A.  1331.,Federal-question jurisdiction was warranted for qui tam action brought under the New York False Claims Act FCA alleging that banks filed fraudulent federal tax forms to claim Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit REMIC tax exemptions for trusts used to issue mortgage-backed securities and that because New York law exempted from state and city taxation an entity that was treated as an REMIC for federal income tax purposes the banks thereby fraudulently avoided paying state and city taxes although only state-law cause of action was asserted central issue of case was whether trusts qualified as valid REMICs under federal tax code the issue was actually disputed by the parties the issue was substantial as it implicated interpretation of federal tax code provision and exercising federal jurisdiction would not upset the federal-state judicial balance as New York state evinced no interest in enacting any law governing REMICs that deviated in any manner from the federal tax code and federal jurisdiction would affect only a tiny fraction of state false-claim action. 26 U.S.C.A.  860Da4 860Ga3A 26 C.F.R.  1.860G-2f2 28 U.S.C.A.  1331 N.Y.

Secured creditor moved to strike testimony of debtors expert regarding appropriate cramdown rate of interest. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas denied the motion to strike adopted experts analysis as correct and confirmed the plan. Secured creditor appealed. The District Court John H. McBryde J. 2011 WL 5429087 affirmed and secured creditor appealed. Debtors moved to dismiss appeal as equitably moot.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Patrick E. Higginbotham Circuit Judge held that  1 the appeal was not equitably moot  2 the Court of Appeals reviews a bankruptcy courts entire cramdown-rate analysis only for clear error and  3 the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in approving a 5 cramdown rate of interest.  Affirmed. ,Doctrine of equitable mootness is unique to bankruptcy proceedings responsive to the reality that there is a point beyond which a court cannot order fundamental changes in reorganization actions.,To establish the equitable mootness of an appeal Chapter 11 debtor-appellee must show that 1 the plan of reorganization has not been stayed 2 the plan has been substantially consummated and 3 the relief requested by the appellant would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.,Fifth Circuit has taken a narrow view of equitable mootness particularly where pleaded against a secured creditor.,Secured creditors appeal from district court decision affirming bankruptcy courts confirmation of Chapter 11 debtors cramdown plan was not equitably moot although secured creditor conceded that plan had not been stayed and that plan had been substantially consummated debtors concerns that granting relief to secured creditor would result in a cataclysmic unwinding of the plan jeopardizing nearly 8 million in distributions made under the plan as well as numerous transactions with third parties need not have been realized as Court of Appeals could grant partial relief to secured creditor without disturbing the reorganization such as by awarding a slightly higher cramdown interest rate or granting a small money judgment and debtors did not present compelling evidence that granting fractional relief would unduly burden the rights of third parties not before the court. 11 U.S.C.A.  1129b.,Equitable mootness protects only the rights of parties not before the court.,Court of Appeals reviews a trial courts decision to admit expert testimony for abuse of discretion.,Rule governing expert testimony requires trial courts to ensure that proffered expert testimony is not only relevant but reliable. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,To determine reliability of proffered expert testimony trial court must make a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology can properly be applied to the facts in issue. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,Trial court ought not transform a Daubert hearing into a trial on the merits.

Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,Where secured creditor in moving to strike the testimony of Chapter 11 debtors expert regarding the appropriate cramdown rate of interest for its secured claim did not challenge experts factual findings calculations or financial projections but rather argued that experts analysis as a whole rested on a flawed understanding of governing Supreme Court precedent such that secured creditors Daubert motion was indistinguishable from its argument on the merits bankruptcy judge reasonably deferred secured creditors Daubert argument to the plan confirmation hearing instead of deciding it before the hearing. Fed.Rules Evid.Rule 702 28 U.S.C.A.,Chapter 11 debtor may cram down a reorganization plan over the dissent of a secured creditor only if the plan provides the creditor with deferred payments of a value at least equal to the allowed amount of the secured claim as of the effective date of the plan in other words the deferred payments discounted to present value by applying an appropriate interest rate that is the cramdown rate must equal the allowed amount of the secured creditors claim. 11 U.S.C.A.  1129b.,Fifth Circuit reviews a bankruptcy courts entire cramdown-rate analysis in Chapter 11 including both its factual findings and its choice of methodology only for clear error. 11 U.S.C.A.  1129b.,Panel of the Fifth Circuit may only overrule a prior panel decision if such overruling is unequivocally directed by controlling Supreme Court precedent.,Under the Till pluralitys prime-plus formula method for calculating the Chapter 13 cramdown rate of interest on a secured claim bankruptcy court should begin its cramdown rate analysis with the national prime rate that is the rate charged by banks to creditworthy commercial borrowers and then add a supplemental risk adjustment to account for such factors as the circumstances of the estate the nature of the security and the duration and feasibility of the reorganization plan. 11 U.S.C.A.  1129b.,Bankruptcy court did not clearly err in confirming Chapter 11 plan that contained 5 cramdown rate of interest for creditors secured claim cramdown rate determination of debtors expert on which court relied rested on uncontroversial application of Till pluralitys prime-plus formula method for calculating Chapter 13 cramdown interest expert engaged in holistic evaluation of debtors concluding that quality of estate was sterling that debtors revenues were exceeding projections that creditors collateral primarily real estate was liquid and stable or appreciating in value and that reorganization plan would be tight but feasible based on these findings which were independently verified by creditors expert debtors expert assessed risk adjustment of 1.75 over prime which fell squarely within range of adjustments that other courts had assessed in similar circumstances and creditors expert predicated his 8.8 rate on analysis rejected by Till plurality. 11 U.S.C.A.  1129b.

Concepcion that the Federal Arbitration Act FAA preempted state contract laws that conditioned the enforceability of consumer arbitration agreements on the availability of classwide arbitration procedures and thus banks waiver of its right to arbitration pursuant to account agreements was not excused on futility grounds when twice invited to file a motion to compel bank could have argued exactly what the Supreme Court held in Concepcion as neither Supreme Court nor circuit precedents foreclosed that argument. 9 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.,Because the court does not require a litigant to engage in futile gestures a party will not waive its right to arbitrate by failing to act whenever any motion to compel would almost certainly have been futile.,A party must move to compel arbitration whenever it should have been clear to the party that the arbitration agreement was at least arguably enforceable.
../../files/WestLaw/Wells Fargo/119 - In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation.txt, Background Automated teller machine ATM cardholders brought antitrust class action against banks and former and current corporate owner-operators of ATM network alleging horizontal price fixing of fees paid to ATM owners by banks that issued cardholders ATM cards when cardholders retrieved cash from ATMs not owned by their banks. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California Charles R. Breyer J. 2010 WL 3701912 granted summary judgment for defendants and subsequently 2010 WL 4918971 denied motion to vacate. Cardholders appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals N.R. Smith Circuit Judge held that  1 cardholders were indirect purchasers  2 cardholders did not have antitrust standing pursuant to co-conspirator exception to Illinois Brick rule restricting antitrust standing to direct purchasers abrogating In re TFTLCD Flat Panel Antitrust Litigation 267 F.R.D. 291 and  3 cardholders did not have antitrust standing pursuant to ownership or control exception to Illinois Brick rule restricting antitrust standing to direct purchasers.  Affirmed. ,Standing is a question of law for the district court to decide.,Because the court and not a jury decides question of standing the district court must decide issues of fact necessary to make the standing determination.,Fact-finding of the district court to support or deny standing is subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.,When standing is challenged on summary judgment district court cannot grant summary judgment if the nonmovant shows that there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56a 28 U.S.C.A.,When a district court determines standing on summary judgment Court of Appeals must determine de novo viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.,In the absence of genuine issues of material fact Court of Appeals may affirm the district courts summary judgment on any ground supported by the record regardless of whether the district court relied upon rejected or even considered that ground if movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 56a 28 U.S.C.A.,Since direct purchaser is injured in its business as required for antitrust standing under Clayton Act even though it passes on claimed illegal overcharges to its customers defendants may not use a pass-on theory to challenge standing of direct purchasers. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Under Clayton Act pursuant to Illinois Brick rule indirect purchasers may not use a pass-on theory to recover damages due to claimed illegal overcharges caused by price fixing and thus have no antitrust standing to sue. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Only direct purchasers have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Indirect purchasers have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations where preexisting cost-plus contract with direct purchaser exists. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Pursuant to co-conspirator exception to Illinois Brick rule that only direct purchasers have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations indirect purchaser may have standing to bring suit where he establishes a price-fixing conspiracy between the manufacturer and the middleman however for indirect purchaser to merit standing under this exception the conspiracy must fix the price paid by plaintiffs. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Pursuant to exception to Illinois Brick rule that only direct purchasers have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations indirect purchasers may sue when customers of direct purchaser own or control direct purchaser or when conspiring seller owns or controls direct purchaser such as when direct purchaser is division or subsidiary of price-fixing seller. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Automated teller machine ATM cardholders were indirect purchasers in determining whether cardholders had antitrust standing to seek damages for alleged horizontal price fixing of interchange fees paid to ATM owners by banks that issued cardholders ATM cards when cardholders retrieved cash from ATMs not owned by their banks cardholders did not directly pay such interchange fees which instead were paid by issuing banks and then included or passed on in foreign ATM fees that were independently set by banks and charged to cardholders. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Automated teller machine ATM cardholders did not have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations pursuant to co-conspirator exception to Illinois Brick rule under which only direct purchasers had such standing in cardholders action asserting horizontal price fixing of fees paid to ATM owners by banks that issued cardholders ATM cards when cardholders retrieved cash from ATMs not owned by their banks given that cardholders did not allege conspiracy by banks and by ATM network to set foreign ATM fees that were paid by cardholders as required to trigger exception and instead alleged conspiracy to set interchange fees that were paid by banks and then passed through to cardholders abrogating In re TFTLCD Flat Panel Antitrust Litigation 267 F.R.D. 291. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Price paid by plaintiffs must be the price set and not merely fixed in some broad sense for plaintiffs to be direct purchasers under narrowly defined injury requirement of Clayton Acts antitrust standing provision. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,To trigger co-conspirator exception to Illinois Brick rule that only direct purchasers have standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations price paid by plaintiff must be set by the conspiracy and not merely affected by the setting of another price. Clayton Act  4a 15 U.S.C.A.  15a.,Automated teller machine ATM cardholders did not allege that ATM network owned or controlled banks that issued cardholders ATM cards or that issuing banks owned or controlled one other and banks small ownership interest in networks corporate owner and operator was insufficient to establish control and therefore exception to Illinois Brick rule restricting standing to direct purchasers which was applicable when ownership or control of direct purchasers by conspiring sellers precluded realistic possibility that antitrust action would be brought did not apply to give cardholders standing under Clayton Act to seek damages for antitrust violations based upon alleged horizontal price fixing of fees paid to ATM owners by banks that issued cardholders ATM cards when cardholders retrieved cash from ATMs not owned by their banks.

The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted lenders motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals held that  1 daughter of deed of trust borrower who acquired deed of trust property by means of quitclaim deed from her father and made payments on deed of trust note for roughly two years before loan went into default had standing to contest validity of deed of trust foreclosure but  2 lender presented sufficient evidence of its ownership of deed of trust note to be allowed to foreclose.  Affirmed. ,Daughter of deed of trust borrower who acquired deed of trust property by means of quitclaim deed from her father and made payments on deed of trust note for roughly two years before loan went into default had standing to sue for wrongful acceleration though she was never substituted as party on note or deed of trust.,Lender presented sufficient evidence of its ownership of deed of trust note based on stamped endorsement of original deed of trust creditor and on fact that deed of trust borrower and individual to whom he had transferred property had made their regular monthly payments to lender for several years before they belatedly questioned its ownership of note to be permitted to foreclose following default in payment.,District court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for reconsideration of earlier order of court finding that lender was owner of deed of trust note with standing to foreclose on deed of trust property on ground that evidence which movant presented in support of motion for reconsideration such as unendorsed copy of deed of trust note that movant had received before action was filed was not newly discovered or based on insufficiency of other evidence such as evidence that individual who signed document transferring deed of trust from recording service to lender that instituted foreclosure action was attorney and not an officer of recording service to support reconsideration mortgage note had been endorsed from original to foreclosing lender and there was complete lack of evidence that foreclosing lender which had been receiving deed of trust payments for years was not owner of note or that movant had any legitimate fear that another entity might approach her to demand payment in future.

Affirmed. ,When construing a state statute absent explicit state-court guidance federal court must attempt to predict state law not to create or modify it.,Under RookerFeldman doctrine inferior federal courts do not have the power to modify or reverse state court judgments except when authorized by Congress.,When a state-court loser presents an independent claim to a federal court albeit a claim that denies a legal conclusion that the state court reached state-law preclusion principles control rather than the RookerFeldman doctrine.,RookerFeldman doctrine does not prohibit a federal district court from reviewing non-state-court decisions.,RookerFeldman doctrine does not bar a challenge in federal court to a rule on which a state-court judicial decision was based if the rule was promulgated in a non-judicial proceeding.,RookerFeldman doctrine did not deprive district court of jurisdiction over mortgagors claims that banks violated Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law LUTPA in connection with foreclosure by executory process mortgagors federal-court claims were independent of state-court proceedings as mortgagor did not seek to overturn foreclosure judgment and damages she requested were not for injuries arising from foreclosure but for injuries caused by banks actions in misleading state court into thinking that executory process evidence was authentic and in misleading mortgagor into foregoing her opportunity to dispute evidences authenticity in state court.

The United States District Court for the District of Delaware Joseph J. Farnan J. 2009 WL 840589 and 2009 WL 1529861dismissed action and denied leave to amend 2010 WL 2245029. Trustee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Greenaway Jr. Circuit Judge held that  1 mere exchange of future credit information was not sufficient for per se price-fixing claim or group boycott claim  2 trustees allegations were not entitled to assumptions of truth due to their conclusory nature  3 trustee did not sufficiently plead direct evidence of agreement to fix credit terms and  4 trustee did not plausibly show existence of agreement to restrain trade through circumstantial evidence of parallel behavior.  Affirmed. ,To determine the sufficiency of a complaint on motion to dismiss a court must take note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim the court should identify allegations that because they are no more than conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth and where there are well-pleaded factual allegations a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 8a2 28 U.S.C.A.,Unilateral action regardless of the motivation is not restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,An unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act is analyzed under either the per se standard or the rule of reason standard. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act the per se illegality rule applies when a business practice on its face has no purpose except stifling competition. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act agreements that fall under established per se illegality categories are conclusively presumed to unreasonably restrain competition paradigmatic examples are horizontal agreements among competitors to fix prices or to divide markets. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act per se illegality is reserved for only those agreements that are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act agreements that do not fall under per se illegality are analyzed under the rule of reason to determine whether they are an unreasonable restraint on trade. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act under the rule of reason analysis the plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that the alleged agreement produced an adverse anticompetitive effect within the relevant geographic market satisfying this burden typically includes a demonstration of defendants market power. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Mere exchange of future credit information was not sufficient for per se price-fixing claim or group boycott claim under Sherman Act against factors that played role in financing purchase and sale transactions between garment retailers and garment manufacturers since price and credit information were distinct information concerning creditworthiness of customers could protect competitors from insolvent customers and factors did not have agreement to restrain trade. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Exchanging information regarding the creditworthiness of customers does not violate the Sherman Act. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Allegations were not entitled to assumptions of truth due to their conclusory nature on illegal price fixing and illegal group boycott claims under Sherman Act against factors that played role in financing purchase and sale transactions between garment retailers and garment manufacturers Chapter 7 trustee alleged that factors regularly and unlawfully shared highly confidential information relating to factored customers and clients and then reached illegal agreements regarding the terms and conditions of credit to be extended and declined and limited credit to retailer at approximately the same time and acted in concert when limiting or refusing to extend credit to retailer.

Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1 Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 8a2 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,A price-fixing claim under the Sherman Act under the rule of reason analysis requires a plaintiff to plead either direct evidence of an agreement or circumstantial evidence of the plausibility of an agreement the plausibility determination is a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1 Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 8a2 28 U.S.C.A.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act direct evidence of a conspiracy is evidence that is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.

Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1 Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rules 8a2 12b6 28 U.S.C.A.,On an unreasonable restraint on trade claim under the Sherman Act circumstantial evidence of parallel behavior must be pled in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action evidence of parallel conduct by alleged co-conspirators is not sufficient to show an agreement. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Conscious parallelism a common reaction of firms in a concentrated market that recognize their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions does not suffice as an agreement to restrain trade in violation of the Sherman Act. Sherman Act  1 15 U.S.C.A.  1.,Parallel conduct in itself is insufficient to state a plausible restraint of trade claim under the Sherman Act because it is consistent with conspiracy but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.

Hochberg J. dismissed RICO and Sherman Act claims on pleading grounds and state law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction. Borrowers appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Roth Circuit Judge held that  1 RICO claim predicated on mail and wire fraud was not pled with sufficient particularity  2 antitrust claim was based on misrepresentations in information given to consumers and independent financial publications and also had to be pled with specificity and  3 granting leave to amend complaint would be futile.  Affirmed. ,In deciding motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim courts generally consider only allegations in complaint exhibits attached to complaint matters of public record and documents that form basis of claim i.e. that are integral to or explicitly relied upon in complaint.

The United States District Court for the District of Arizona Roslyn O. Silver Senior District Judge 2012 WL 8147128 granted summary judgment to the defendants finding the provider lacked Article III standing. The provider appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals W. Fletcher Circuit Judge held that  1 the provider as the assignee of the beneficiaries had Article III standing to challenge the plan administrators refusal to pay benefits  2 the providers assignment agreement did not assign the beneficiaries breach of fiduciary duties claims to the provider  3 the association lacked constitutional standing to bring action on behalf of its members  4 one beneficiarys breach of fiduciary duties claim was barred by three-year statute of limitations  5 a beneficiary was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing his breach of fiduciary duties claim  6 a two-year limitations period to bring claims in the summary plan description SPD was unenforceable and  7 the administrator did not waive any right to enforce a plans anti-assignment provision.  Reversed in part affirmed in part vacated in part and remanded. ,The Court of Appeals reviews de novo a district courts Article III standing determination. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,The Court of Appeals reviews de novo a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.,Because the potential applicability vel non of exhaustion principles to ERISA claim is a question of law the Court of Appeals considers it de novo. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  2 et seq. 29 U.S.C.A.  1001 et seq.,Since ERISA plan beneficiaries had Article III standing to challenge the claims administrators refusal to pay claims submitted by a health care provider the provider had Article III standing to challenge the refusal after the beneficiaries assigned their rights and benefits under the ERISA plan to the provider even though the provider did not attempt to collect payment from the beneficiaries for the unpaid balances. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  502a 29 U.S.C.A.  1132a.,ERISA provides for a federal cause of action for civil claims aimed at enforcing the provisions of an ERISA plan. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  502e1 29 U.S.C.A.  1132e1.,In order to establish Article III standing a plaintiff must show 1 it has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent not conjectural or hypothetical 2 the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and 3 it is likely as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,An agreement which assigned the rights and benefits of ERISA plan beneficiaries under a benefits policy to a health care provider did not assign the beneficiaries right to bring claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the plans claims administrator where the entire focus of the agreement was to allow the provider to seek payment for the medical services it provided. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  502a 29 U.S.C.A.  1132a.,A non-profit association of chiropractors lacked constitutional standing to bring action on behalf of its members against an ERISA benefits plan and its claims administrator that allegedly refused to pay for certain therapies or reimbursed at an improperly low rate where the relief sought would require the participant of the associations individual members as some members were allegedly denied payment altogether while others received partial payments. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  502a 29 U.S.C.A.  1132a.,An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when 1 its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right 2 the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organizations purpose and 3 neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.,An association has constitutional standing only to seek relief that would not require the participation of its individual members. U.S.C.A. Const. Art. 3  2 cl. 1.,Cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty accrued and the three-year limitations period began to run when a beneficiary of an ERISA plan was aware that the claims administrator was not following claims regulations was not considering all relevant information in making benefits decisions and was improperly denying and delaying payment on valid claims.

Sack Circuit Judge filed opinion concurring in the result. ,Owner of motivational services business with registered service mark in Own Your Power did not have to show that competitor was using allegedly infringing content as a mark as threshold issue in order to establish reverse consumer confusion within market for motivational services and publications. Lanham Act  32 43 15 U.S.C.A.  1114 1125.,The Lanham Act protects marks against direct confusion where there is a likelihood that consumers will believe that the trademark owner sponsors or endorses the use of the challenged mark.

Lanham Act  32 43 45 15 U.S.C.A.  1114 1125 1127.,In determining whether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion on a trademark infringement claim under the Lanham Act a court considers 1 strength of the trademark 2 similarity of the marks 3 proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another 4 evidence that the senior user may bridge the gap by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringers product 5 evidence of actual consumer confusion 6 evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith 7 respective quality of the products and 8 sophistication of consumers in the relevant market. Lanham Act  32 15 U.S.C.A.  1114.,Court of Appeals analysis of eight factors used to determine likelihood of confusion in trademark infringement case is not mechanical but rather focuses on the ultimate question of whether looking at the products in their totality consumers are likely to be confused. Lanham Act  321a 43a1 15 U.S.C.A.  11141a 1125a1.,Because fair use is an affirmative defense it often requires consideration of facts outside of the complaint and thus is inappropriate to resolve on a motion to dismiss however affirmative defenses may be adjudicated at this stage in the litigation where the facts necessary to establish the defense are evident on the face of the complaint.

Lanham Act  33b4 15 U.S.C.A.  1115b4.,A slogan and a single brand name can serve as co-existent marks under the Lanham Act. Lanham Act  321a 43a1 15 U.S.C.A.  11141a 1125a1.,Competitor did not carry its burden at pleading stage on claim to fair use defense of showing that use of phrase Own Your Power was descriptive of publications to which that phrase was attached on claim of infringement by owner of motivational services business with registered service mark in Own Your Power since phrase was not in common usage and it did not appear that phrase Own Your Power was meant by competitor to describe contents of allegedly infringing publications.

Lanham Act  33b4 15 U.S.C.A.  1115b4.,On a claim to the fair use defense to allegation of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act a court equates a lack of good faith with the subsequent users intent to trade on the good will of the trademark holder by creating confusion as to source or sponsorship even where there is no direct evidence of intent if there is additional evidence that supports the inference that the defendant sought to confuse consumers as to the source of the product the inference of bad faith may fairly be drawn. Lanham Act  33b4 15 U.S.C.A.  1115b4.,On a claim to the fair use defense to allegation of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act a plaintiff may show an absence of good faith where a junior user had knowledge or constructive knowledge of the senior users mark and chose to adopt a similar mark. Lanham Act  33b4 15 U.S.C.A.  1115b4.,Lanham Act plaintiffs need not satisfy the first element of a fair use defense as a threshold requirement for bringing claims pursuant to the Lanham Act. Lanham Act  33b4 15 U.S.C.A.  1115b4.,Vicarious liability for trademark infringement requires a finding that the defendant and the infringer have an apparent or actual partnership have authority to bind one another in transactions with third parties or exercise joint ownership or control over the infringing product. Lanham Act  321a 43a1 15 U.S.C.A.  11141a 1125a1.,Corporations did not intentionally induce infringement of Own Your Power service mark by merely sponsoring event that allegedly used mark in publications in infringing manner since sponsorship was not supplying product to infringer with knowledge that infringer was mislabeling that product. Lanham Act  321a 43a1 15 U.S.C.A.  11141a 1125a1.,To be liable for contributory trademark infringement a defendant must have 1 intentionally induced the primary infringer to infringe or 2 continued to supply an infringing product to an infringer with knowledge that the infringer is mislabeling the particular product supplied. Lanham Act  321a 43a1 15 U.S.C.A.  11141a 1125a1.,Competitors use of phrase Own Your Power in association with its Internet website and magazine was not counterfeit under Lanham Act since font color and capitalization of owners service mark differed from offending uses made by competitor although accused publications were in competition with owners own services and publications consumers interacted with website and magazine visually and would have recognized differences between owners mark and competitors representations of words Own Your Power from cursory visual inspection. Lanham TradeMark Act  45 15 U.S.C.A.  1127.,Competitors use of phrase Own Your Power in association with its event was not counterfeit under Lanham Act although audience member might have encountered phrase Own Your Power aurally competitors Own Your Power logo figured prominently in displays featured at event logo was markedly different from owners own mark and majority of audience members encountered event only later through video clips on Internet website which contained obvious visual differences from owners mark.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York Isreal Leo Glasser J. granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint. Homeowners appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Sack Circuit Judge held that  1 RESPA subsection prohibiting any person from giving or accepting any part of a fee unless services were actually performed does not prohibit overcharges  2 the subject RESPA subsection is ambiguous with respect to its coverage of mark-ups  3 Chevron deference was due the Department of Housing and Urban Developments HUDs policy statement interpreting the RESPA subsection in question to prohibit mark-ups and  4 homeowners mark-up allegations stated a cause of action for defendants violation of RESPA.  Affirmed in part vacated and remanded in part. ,In the context of a lenders provision of real estate settlement services overcharges are charges arising out of settlement services provided by the lender itself but charged to consumers seeking home mortgages for substantially more than the providers cost. Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act of 1974  2 et seq. as amended 12 U.S.C.A.  2601 et seq.,Real estate settlement service provider marks up the fee for a settlement service when the provider outsources the task of providing the service to a third-party vendor pays the vendor a fee for the service and then without providing an additional service charges homeowners seeking mortgages a higher fee for the settlement service than that which the provider paid to the third-party vendor. Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act of 1974  2 et seq. as amended 12 U.S.C.A.  2601 et seq.,District courts judgment on the pleadings involving questions of statutory construction would be reviewed de novo.,Question of the appropriate level of deference to accord agency regulations is one purely of law subject to de novo review.,In determining whether a federal statute interpreted by an agency clearly and unambiguously prohibits the practices of which plaintiffs complain if the intent of Congress is clear that is the end of the matter for the court as well as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.,If Chevron deference to an agencys interpretation of a statute is required the court must defer to the interpretation advanced by the agency unless it is arbitrary capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.,So long as an agencys reading of a statute fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislatures design court gives that reading controlling weight even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.,If a court concludes that a statute is ambiguous but decides that no deference to an agencys interpretation of the statute is required then the court resolves the ambiguity itself using the customary means of judicial statutory interpretation.,Federal rules permit pleading inconsistent theories in the alternative. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 8e2 28 U.S.C.A.,Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA subsection prohibiting any person from giving or accepting any part of a fee unless services were actually performed does not prohibit overcharges that is a lenders practice of providing real estate settlement services itself but charging consumers substantially more than the lenders cost whatever its size a fee is for the services rendered by the institution and received by the borrower the RESPA subsection at issue does not impose price controls and nothing in the statute authorizes a court to divide a charge into its reasonable and unreasonable components.

Massachusetts law when a contracts terms are ambiguous uncertain or equivocal in meaning the intent of the parties is a question of fact to be determined at trial.,Under Massachusetts law to establish breach of contract plaintiff must prove that a valid binding contract existed defendant breached the terms of the contract and plaintiff sustained damages as a result of the breach.,Under Massachusetts law the lenders increase of the payment amount due under permanent mortgage modification agreement from amount due during trial period plan TPP did not breach the TPP terms of the TPP stated that the actual payments under the modified loan terms could be different and explained how the lender would calculate that payment.,Mortgagors allegations that lender made repeated mistakes and delays in offering her a permanent mortgage modification including that the end of the trial period passed without the proffer of a permanent modification agreement were sufficient to put lender on notice of mortgagors claim under Massachusetts law that lender breached trial period plan TPP by failing to send a permanent modification agreement before or at the end of the trial period.,Mortgagor sufficiently preserved for review her claim that lender breached trial period plan TPP by failing to send a permanent modification agreement before or at the end of the trial period

of good faith and fair dealing carries an implication of a dishonest purpose conscious doing of wrong or breach of duty through motive of self-interest or ill will.,Under Massachusetts law evidence that a party behaved in a manner unreasonable under all the circumstances may indicate a lack of good faith as would support a claim of breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing but the core question remains whether the alleged conduct was motivated by a desire to gain an unfair advantage or otherwise had the effect of injuring the other partys rights to the fruits of the contract.,Under Massachusetts law the concept of good faith is shaped by the nature of the contractual relationship from which the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing derives and the scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract that governs the particular relationship as a consequence the implied covenant cannot create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship and instead focuses on the manner of performance.,Mortgagors allegations that lender falsely informed her that she was ineligible for permanent mortgage modification and that after admitting its error promised modification in an untimely manner were insufficient under Massachusetts law to state a claim of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing allegations painted a picture of an unthinking and sloppy institution rather than one that acted with an improper purpose.,By failing to address question of lenders duty under Massachusetts law in opening brief on appeal mortgagor waived claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.,Under Massachusetts law duty is a necessary ingredient of an action for negligence.,To make out an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim under Massachusetts law plaintiff must demonstrate that defendant 1 intended to inflict emotional distress by 2 undertaking actions that were extreme and outrageous thereby 3 causing emotional distress which 4 was severe.,For purpose of stating an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim under Massachusetts law extreme and outrageous conduct is behavior that is so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.,Mortgagor failed to state a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress under Massachusetts law based on lenders actions in mortgage modification proceedings absent allegation that lender acted with the requisite intent or that the inconvenience and agitation mortgagor endured rose to such a level that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.,A practice is unfair within meaning of Massachusetts unfair or deceptive acts or practices law if it is within the penumbra of some common-law statutory or other established concept of unfairness is immoral unethical oppressive or unscrupulous and causes substantial injury. M.G.L.A. c. 93A  1 et seq.,Violation of a statute is not a necessary element of an unfair debt collection practices claim under Massachusetts law as the law creates new substantive rights and in particular cases makes conduct unlawful which was not unlawful under the common law or any prior statute.

1334.,Whether plaintiff has fraudulently joined a party to defeat diversity jurisdiction is question of subject matter jurisdiction which the Court of Appeals reviews de novo.,Nondiverse party is fraudulently joined if there is no reasonable basis in fact and law for the claim brought against it.,When applicable state precedent precludes the existence of cause of action against nondiverse defendant joinder of nondiverse defendant is fraudulent.,Under Missouri law first essential element of claim of negligence is existence of a duty.,Under Missouri law duties of trustee under deed of trust were fixed by contract namely by deed of trust and did not include duty and responsibility to oversee servicing of deed of trust borrowers loan absent any language in deed of trust imposing such a duty.,To prove a breach of fiduciary duty under Missouri law plaintiff must establish among other elements that a fiduciary duty existed and was breached.,Missouri law recognizes a fiduciary relationship between trustee of deed of trust and both the debtor and creditor trustee is considered to be agent of both debtor and creditor and should perform duties of the trust with impartiality and integrity.,While trustee of deed of trust may have represented deed of trust lender in certain respects this alleged representation of lender was not inconsistent with the dual-agency relationship contemplated by Missouri law and would not support breach of fiduciary duty claim against trustee.,Conduct of trustee under deed of trust when it applied portion of proceeds generated by foreclosure to payment of its trustees fee was not a breach of its fiduciary duty to deed of trust borrowers where deed of trust expressly provided that trustee could apply proceeds of foreclosure sale to all expenses of the sale including but not limited to reasonable Trustees and attorneys fees.,Under Missouri law when deed of trust creditor requests that trustee foreclose trustee may proceed without making any affirmative investigation unless trustee has actual knowledge of anything which should legally prevent the foreclosure.,Deed of trust borrowers did not have reasonable basis in fact and law for breach of fiduciary duty claim against trustee of deed of trust for honoring deed of trust lenders request that it foreclose based on borrowers admitted default in payment without investigating circumstances surrounding that default even assuming that borrowers had informed trustee of their discussions with lender about obtaining modification of loan and of oral statement allegedly made by lenders agent that their latest modification request would stop all foreclosure processes where deed of trust contained a no-oral-modifications clause.,Doctrine of fraudulent joinder allowed district court only temporary jurisdiction to determine whether facially nondiverse defendant was fraudulently joined in removed action and did not allow court upon finding that plaintiffs had no reasonable basis for asserting claim against nondiverse defendant and that nondiverse defendant was fraudulently joined to dismiss claims against nondiverse defendant with prejudice district courts dismissal of claims asserted against fraudulently-joined nondiverse defendant should have been without prejudice as court was without jurisdiction to resolve such claims on merits.,Federal courts role in diversity cases is to interpret state law not to fashion it.,When determining scope of state law federal court is bound by decisions of states highest court.,When states highest court has not spoken on state law issue federal court must predict how that court would rule and will follow decisions from intermediate state courts when they are the best evidence of state law.,Under Missouri law plaintiff seeking damages in wrongful foreclosure action must plead and prove that when foreclosure proceeding was begun there was no default on its part that would give rise to right to foreclose.,Under Missouri law as predicted by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals deed of trust borrowers could not rely on lulling theory to assert wrongful foreclosure claim against deed of trust lender despite their admitted default in payment by alleging that they were lulled into false sense of security by oral representations by lenders agent that borrowers loan modification request would halt foreclosure sale where deed of trust contained a no-oral-modifications clause Missouri Supreme Court would not as predicted by the Court of Appeals recognize a lulling claim based on lenders oral representations if mortgage or deed of trust expressly prohibited any oral modifications thereof.,To plead fraud with requisite particularity complaint must identify the who what where when and how of the alleged fraud. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 9b 28 U.S.C.A.,Deed of trust borrowers fraud claim against lender for allegedly misrepresenting that their latest loan modification request would halt scheduled foreclosure sale was not pled with requisite particularity where borrowers complaint did not identify the bank employee who allegedly made this false representation. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.Rule 9b 28 U.S.C.A.,No-oral-modifications clause in deed of trust prevented borrowers from reasonably relying on oral statement allegedly made by unidentified bank employee that borrowers latest loan modification request would prevent scheduled foreclosure sale from occurring and precluded fraudulent misrepresentation claim against bank based on falsity of this unidentified bank employees advice.,Deed of trust lender did not waive protections of no-oral-modifications clause included in deed of trust by discussing loan moratorium and modification programs with borrowers and by suggesting that pending modification requests could prevent foreclosure where throughout its discussions with borrowers concerning possibility of a modification lender made clear that payment of amount in default was required offering two proposals for payment of that amount that were rejected by borrowers and also made clear that borrowers were being placed in foreclosure because of their default.,Misrepresentations allegedly made by deed of trust lender to borrowers regarding availability of loan modification after default were not made in connection with sale of the loan as required for borrowers to establish violation of Missouri Merchandising Practices Act MMPA loan modification was not a service the lender agreed to sell or the borrower agreed to buy when the parties agreed to the loan. V.A.M.S.  407.0201.,Deed of trust lenders act of foreclosing on borrowers property despite promising them that applying for a loan modification would suspend a foreclosure sale was in connection with the sale of the borrowers loan as required for borrowers to establish violation of Missouri Merchandising Practices Act MMPA the right to collect a loan was part of the sale. V.A.M.S.  407.0201.,Under Missouri law contractual relationship between deed of trust lender and borrowers did not alone establish a tort duty on part of lender to exercise due care in applying payments calculating interest and fees and servicing the loan such as might support negligence claim against lender for breach of this alleged duty.,To prove negligent misrepresentation under Missouri law plaintiffs must show among other elements that they justifiably relied on information provided to them by defendant.,No-oral-modifications clause in deed of trust prevented borrowers from justifiably relying on oral statement allegedly made by unidentified bank employee that borrowers latest loan modification request would prevent scheduled foreclosure sale from occurring and precluded negligent misrepresentation claim against bank based on falsity of this unidentified bank employees advice.

Motion was denied and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Tenth Circuit Somers J. affirmed. Debtor appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Carlos F. Lucero Circuit Judge held that  1 Chapter 7 trustee did not abandon any alleged claims for stay violations to debtor such that debtor lacked standing to pursue such claims and  2 denial as premature of motion to supplement record that Chapter 7 debtor filed before record was transmitted from lower court did not improperly deny debtor a right to supplement record.  Affirmed. ,Chapter 7 trustee did not abandon any alleged claims for stay violations to debtor such that debtor lacked standing to pursue such claims simply by virtue of trustees notice of abandonment and report of no distribution where there was nothing in notice or report indicating that parties had right to object to proposed abandonment and no indication that either the notice or report was sent to interested parties trustees intent to abandon without prior notice to creditors was insufficient to establish abandonment. 11 U.S.C.A.  554 Fed.Rules Bankr.Proc.Rule 6007a 11 U.S.C.A.,General notice of meeting of creditors which did not mention interested parties right to object to abandonment of estate assets and obtain hearing but merely advised parties of their ability to seek notice of any proposed abandonment did not relieve Chapter 7 trustee of obligation to provide notice in accordance with bankruptcy statute and rule to effect an abandonment of estate asset. 11 U.S.C.A.  554 Fed.Rules Bankr.Proc.Rule 6007a 11 U.S.C.A.,Damages provision of bankruptcy statute governing automatic stay merely provided private cause of action for any willful violations of stay and did not confer standing on Chapter 7 debtor to seek sanctions for alleged stay violations absent abandonment of such stay violation claims by Chapter 7 trustee. 11 U.S.C.A.  362k.,Bankruptcy appellate courts denial as premature of motion to supplement record that Chapter 7 debtor filed before record was transmitted from lower court did not improperly deny debtor a right to supplement record in alleged violation of his due process rights where this denial was without prejudice to debtors right to renew motion a right that debtor failed to exercise following transmission of allegedly inaccurate and incomplete record from lower court in filing motion not to supplement record but to remand.

../../files/WestLaw/Wells Fargo/38 - Twymon v Wells Fargo And Co.txt, Background Terminated employee sued employer under Title VII alleging race discrimination and retaliation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa James E. Gritzner J. 403 F.Supp.2d 921 entered summary judgment in favor of employer. Employee appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Melloy Circuit Judge held that  1 supervisors facially race-neutral statements without more did not demonstrate racial animus required to be direct evidence of race-based employment discrimination  2 alleged Uncle Tom statements made in context of attempting to preserve and promote employees career were not direct evidence of unlawful racial discrimination in terminating her employment  3 stray comments made by supervisor during decisional process accompanying employers termination of employee were not direct evidence of racial animus  4 employee failed to establish that employees legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for employees termination based on her gross violation of the companys computer policy was pretext for racial discrimination and  5 assuming employee established a prima facie case of retaliation she failed to establish that employees legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for her termination was pretextual.  Judgment affirmed. ,A plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VIIs prohibition against race-based termination through either direct or indirect evidence. Civil Rights Act of 1964  703a1 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-2a1.,Direct evidence of employment discrimination is evidence that establishes a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the employers decision direct evidence does not include stray remarks in the workplace statements by nondecisionmakers or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.,Supervisors facially race-neutral statements to African-American employee such as you dont know your place and Midwest nice without more did not demonstrate racial animus required to be direct evidence of race-based employment discrimination under Title VII. Civil Rights Act of 1964  703a1 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-2a1.,Employee relations directors alleged Uncle Tom statements while racially offensive and misguided were apparently made in the context of attempting to preserve and promote African-American employees career not in relation to deciding to terminate her and thus were not direct evidence of unlawful racial discrimination under Title VII. Civil Rights Act of 1964  703a1 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-2a1.,Stray comments made by supervisor during the decisional process accompanying employers termination of African-American employee were not direct evidence of racial animus under Title VII even though they were made by decisionmakers. Civil Rights Act of 1964  703a1 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-2a1.,Under the McDonnell Douglas framework a Title VII plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination by showing that 1 she was a member of a protected class 2 she was meeting the employers legitimate job expectations 3 she suffered an adverse employment action and 4 similarly situated employees outside the protected class were treated differently. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,If a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination is established a burden of production then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for firing the plaintiff and if the employer makes such a showing the plaintiff must then demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the stated non-discriminatory rationale was a mere pretext for discrimination. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,Assuming African-American employee established a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII employee articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for employees termination based on her gross violation of the companys computer policy forbidding excessive personal use of the Internet and e-mail as well as the receipt storage or dissemination of obscene materials evidence proffered by employer included a log of websites accessed from employees assigned IP address and images of nude and partially-nude males recovered from her computer hard drive. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,African-American employee failed to establish that employees legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for employees termination based on her gross violation of the companys computer policy was pretext for racial discrimination under Title VII even considering employees bare assertion that someone else could have accessed her computer she failed to demonstrate that employer terminated her improperly or even assert that employer did not honestly believe she was accountable for violations of the computer policy when they fired her for those violations and she failed to offer evidence raising an inference that her termination was truly racially motivated. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,To prove pretext for Title VII discrimination a plaintiff must both discredit an employers asserted reason for termination and show that the circumstances permit drawing the reasonable inference that the real reason for terminating the plaintiff was her race. Civil Rights Act of 1964  701 et seq. 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e et seq.,A proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reason for termination need not in the end be correct if the employer honestly believed the asserted grounds at the time of the termination.,Contrasting the treatment of similarly situated employees outside of the protected class with the employees treatment is one way to point towards a race-based motivation for an adverse employment decision.,Assuming African-American employee established a prima facie case of retaliation she failed to establish that employees legitimate non-discriminatory rationale for employees termination based on her gross violation of the companys computer policy was pretextual under Title VII. Civil Rights Act of 1964  704a 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-3a.,When no direct evidence of discriminatory retaliation is asserted the McDonnell Douglas analysis applies and the plaintiff must first put forth a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of Title VII. Civil Rights Act of 1964  704a 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-3a.,To establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discrimination a plaintiff must show 1 she engaged in activity protected by Title VII 2 an adverse employment action occurred and 3 a causal connection existed between participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Civil Rights Act of 1964  704a 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-3a.,If the plaintiff puts forth a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII the employer may rebut the resulting presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Civil Rights Act of 1964  704a 42 U.S.C.A.  2000e-3a.,If an employer proffers a race-neutral rationale for alleged retaliation under Title VII the plaintiff may attempt to refute the asserted reason as mere pretext.

Banks moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York Brian Mark Cogan J. 117 F.Supp.3d 215 granted motion and relators appealed.  Holdings The Court of Appeals Katzmann Chief Judge held that  1 certification which banks had made in order to obtain short-term financing from the Federal Reserves discount window was far too broad to qualify as false claim actionable under the FCA  2 documents that banks were required to submit in applying for loan which consisted inter alia of documents specifying their official name and providing contact information but did not include any financial information about banks were insufficient to support FCA claim  3 tangential relationship between banks submission of documents to regulators and the Federal Reserves use of that information to determine eligibility for borrowing at some later point was insufficient to support liability under the False Claims Act FCA on an implied certification theory and  4 district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing qui tam claims with prejudice without leave to amend.

../../files/WestLaw/Wells Fargo/44 - In re Oparaji.txt, Background Chapter 13 debtor brought adversary proceeding alleging that both equitable estoppel and judicial estoppel applied to bar deed of trust lender from asserting claims in case that were inconsistent with claims previously asserted in debtors prior Chapter 13 case and seeking sanctions against lender and its attorneys for presenting false proofs of claim. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas 454 B.R. 725 granted summary judgment for debtor on judicial estoppel theory denied equitable estoppel claim as moot and granted summary judgment for lender and its attorneys on sanctions claim and thereafter issued amended order clarifying prior order. Lender appealed. The District Court Sim Lake J. 458 B.R. 881 affirmed. Lender appealed.  Holding The Court of Appeals Edith Brown Clement Circuit Judge held that deed of trust lender in failing to include all of the arrearages allegedly incurred by deed of trust borrower in proofs of claim filed in debtor-borrowers previous Chapter 13 case was not asserting position that was inconsistent with the significantly larger arrearage claim that it filed in debtors second Chapter 13 case.  Reversed and remanded. ,On appeal from district courts decision in its bankruptcy appellate capacity the Court of Appeals applies same standard of review that the district court applied to bankruptcy courts decisions.,Decision to invoke doctrine of judicial estoppel is typically reviewed for abuse of discretion.,Grant of summary judgment is generally reviewed de novo.,Doctrine of judicial estoppel is common law doctrine by which party who has assumed one position in his pleadings may be estopped from assuming an inconsistent position particularly in situations where intentional self-contradiction is being used as means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice.,Judicial estoppel doctrine serves the clear and undisputed jurisprudential purpose of protecting integrity of courts.,Deed of trust lender in failing to include all of the arrearages allegedly incurred by deed of trust borrower in proofs of claim filed in debtor-borrowers previous Chapter 13 case was not asserting position that was inconsistent with the significantly larger arrearage claim that it filed following entry of order dismissing this prior case in debtor-borrowers second successive Chapter 13 case accordingly proofs of claim filed in prior case did not judicially estop lender from later filing arrearage claim in alleged full amount of arrearage.,Courts generally consider three criteria when evaluating defense of judicial estoppel 1 whether party against whom judicial estoppel is sought has asserted legal position that is plainly inconsistent with position asserted in prior case 2 whether court in prior case accepted partys original position thus creating perception that one or both courts were misled and 3 whether party to be estopped has acted other than inadvertently.,Court is reluctant to apply judicial estoppel in situations in which partys alleged change of position is merely implied rather than clear and express.,Second requirement for application of judicial estoppel judicial acceptance ensures that judicial estoppel is applied only in situations in which integrity of judiciary is jeopardized.,Absent judicial acceptance of inconsistent position application of judicial estoppel is unwarranted because no risk of inconsistent results exists.,Even assuming that deed of trust lender in failing to include all of the arrearages allegedly incurred by deed of trust borrower in proofs of claim filed in debtor-borrowers previous Chapter 13 case was asserting position that was inconsistent with the significantly larger arrearage claim that it filed in debtor-borrowers second successive Chapter 13 case bankruptcy courts dismissal of prior case without granting debtor a discharge operated for judicial estoppel purposes to undo any acceptance by court of this prior inconsistent position in confirming plan that purported to pay arrearage claim in lesser amount previously sought.,Pre-discharge dismissal of bankruptcy case returns parties to positions that they were in before case was initiated. 11 U.S.C.A.  349b.,When bankruptcy court dismissed debtors prior Chapter 13 case without granting debtor a discharge courts acceptance of debtors plan was negated and parties were no longer bound by its terms. 11 U.S.C.A.  349b.,Chapter 13 plan is exchanged for bargain between debtor and debtors creditors so that when debtor fails to fulfill his end of bargain due to dismissal of underlying case a resulting finding that confirmed Chapter 13 plan is terminated serves to prevent debtor from obtaining benefit of those terms in plan which are advantageous to debtor. 11 U.S.C.A.  349b.,At its core judicial estoppel is equitable remedy that must be applied so as to avoid inequity.,Deed of trust lender in allegedly filing arrearage claims for less than amount of full arrearage owed in debtor-borrowers earlier Chapter 13 case so as to facilitate successful completion of plan and ensure that arrearage would be paid did not gain any unfair benefit such as might support application of judicial estoppel to prevent lender when prior case was dismissed and debtor again filed for bankruptcy from filing proof of claim in this second case for full amount of arrearage previously incurred.
