" steve turner's new biography beatles '66: the revolutionary year (ecco, 464, *** out of four) narrows in on the  midpoint of the band's career, which begins, unremarkably, with a badly needed break from the business of being beatles. off the road and out of the studio for the first time in ages, the weary quartet settle into their own lives in and around london, sopping up avant-garde culture and experimenting with mind-altering drugs. when they reassemble at abbey road in april to record tomorrow never knows, john lennon's rendering of an acid trip, the transformation is unmistakable. as bob dylan vastly underestimates when he hears the song: ""oh, i get it. you don't want to be cute anymore."" the meat of the story is familiar  even to casual fans, who are at least glancingly acquainted with the group's seemingly sudden transition from love songs to psychedelic rock. what music journalist turner brings to his rambling retelling is fantastic access (the book draws upon his interviews with the beatles, as well as producer george martin and george harrison's mentor, ravi shankar) and an extraordinary, peter guralnick-like (last train to memphis: the rise of elvis presley) attention to detail. interestingly, the author  takes an occasionally disappointed view of both lennon and paul mccartney. turner repeatedly references the former's laziness and fixates on the latter's imperfect recall -- most notably, paul's assertion that he tried lsd in late 1966 (rather than 1965), which would have placed him in a significantly different headspace while working on the pivotal revolver album. what the book does particularly well is glimpsing the bandmates in their unguarded moments -- for example, a terrified lennon weeping as the implications of his ""we're more popular than jesus"" remark sink in. equally striking is turner's depiction of four friends readying for the inevitability of life beyond the beatles but still preferring each other's company, touchingly so when ringo starr, missing his mate, flies to spain to spend lennon's 26th birthday with him. turner clearly establishes that the beatles were more than pop stars.

", wants voters to be very, very afraid of his opponent, former police officer paul penzone. so what could be better than an ad that claims that penzone assaulted his wife? a lot actually, since it is a gross overstatement. the charge stems from an argument that penzone and his then-wife had  13 years ago when they were in the final stages of a failing marriage. penzone said at the time that his wife hit him with a hockey stick. she responded by claiming  that he pushed her against the wall. no charges were filed, and a judge dismissed restraining-order requests. this year, penzone's ex-wife threw more cold water on the claim, saying that he was not physically aggressive. but why let the facts get in the way of a good attack ad? medicare scare in illinois at first glance, the ad run by illinois democrat kate cloonen seems like routine stuff. she suggests that her republican opponent, lindsay parkhurst, would take away seniors' medicare and social security. democrats make that case frequently. but normally, they can point to some vote long ago to make modest or necessary reductions in federal spending to support their claim. in this case, the ad is not backed up by the slightest scintilla of evidence. what makes it even more absurd is that the office that cloonen currently holds, and that parkhurst is seeking, is a seat in the state legislature. even if parkhurst wanted to end the two signature federal programs for retirees, she'd have a hard time doing so from her perch in springfield. surely, cloonen can come up with something better than this. fighting the phantom grocery tax if there were an award for ads that are both false and laughable, this year's would have to go to one being run by a california beverage industry group urging residents of oakland to vote against a proposed ""grocery tax."" the ad asserts that the tax would harm small groceries, many of which are doing wonderful things for their communities. one grocer featured in the ads, kay kay amamgbo, proprietor of the african caribbean food market, implores voters not to support the tax. ""there are not a lot of options for fresh food in this neighborhood,"" she says. amamgbo is appealing, and so is the produce the camera zeroes in on as she's talking. but there's one small problem with the ad. there is no grocery tax on the ballot in oakland. the proposal is for a penny-per-ounce excise tax on sugary drinks. maybe ads need nutrition labels. donald trump's dystopic vision of hillary clinton no list of bad ads would be complete without one from donald trump, the venomous and self-destructive republican presidential nominee. the ad that seems to best capture his approach to campaigning asserts that hillary clinton got ""filthy rich"" from ""criminals, dictators, countries that hate america."" this commercial presents a remorselessly bleak picture of the clinton foundation, the non-profit organization founded by her husband. to be sure, the foundation raises issues about the motives behind foreign contributions, and it has served as a comfy resting spot for loyal clinton aides. but it is also a charitable institution doing good works at home and abroad. and hillary clinton's wealth comes mostly from six-figure speaking fees and seven-figure book deals, not from money derived from the foundation. president obama habla espanol? if it sometimes seems like politicians are just repeating their talking points or reading the lines placed in front of them, an ad run by patrick murphy, the democratic candidate for senate in florida, provides ample fodder. murphy, who is challenging republican incumbent marco rubio, needs the support of the state's large latino population. he also knows that president obama is popular with the democratic voters he needs to turn out in huge numbers. the candidate got obama to tape an ad for him, in spanish. in the commercial, obama touts murphy's accomplishments and says words that translate to ""go out and vote for patrick, your vote is very important."" as most people know, obama hardly speak spanish",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"The 5 worst political ads of 2016; Believe it or not, this year's crop of election commercials contains fewer really bad ads than in previous cycles.

" clinton's ranks of elite fundraisers include 201 people who work in the securities and investment sector and dozens more who work in other areas of finance and commercial banking, according to a tally by the center for responsive politics and usa today. together, the broader finance sector has helped collect at least $20 million for her presidential campaign and the democratic party. in all, clinton's 1,370 fundraisers -- dubbed ""hillblazers"" by the campaign -- have bundled together at least $137 million from their friends, family members and business associates to build a money machine that surpasses the fundraising operation that twice helped elect  obama. obama relied on just 769 bundlers in his 2012 re-election, 92 of whom came from the securities and investment industry, the center's data show. clinton's hillblazers range from longtime allies of clinton and her husband, former president bill clinton, to wealthy republicans disenchanted with gop nominee donald trump, such as hewlett packard enterprise chief executive meg whitman. the former secretary of state could choose to draw from the ranks of these loyalists as she looks to fill key administration posts and appoint ambassadors. one hillblazer, former interior secretary ken salazar, leads the team working on her white house transition. clinton's fundraisers have done more than round up checks on her behalf at hollywood events  and parties in the hamptons as she and her allies have amassed roughly $1 billion for her election through traditional fundraising and seven- and eight-figure donations to super pacs. dozens of clinton bundlers have helped bankroll the leading super pac working on clinton's behalf, federal election commission records show. billionaire hedge-fund manager s. donald sussman has donated $19 million to the pac, priorities usa action -- including $6 million last month alone -- and has emerged as one of clinton's largest financial benefactors. on tuesday, priorities officials announced they had raised $175million through oct. 19, cementing the super pac's position as the best-funded outside group of the 2016 election.

""this is the primo list of those who will be first in line for plum posts and perks in the next administration,"" she said. federal law does not require presidential candidates to disclose their bundlers' identities. clinton has done so voluntarily, as she did during her 2008 run for the presidency, and updates the list monthly. trump has not disclosed his bundlers. clinton aides say she has widespread support. ""more than 2.6million americans have donated to this campaign because they know hillary clinton is the best candidate to bring us toward a more inclusive society with an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" said spokesman josh schwerin.

" trump paused his campaigning june 16 to answer questions under oath in one of his lawsuits against two celebrity chefs. he had sued geoffrey zakarian and josí© andrí©s after they backed out of a restaurant deal in response to trump's inflammatory statements about mexican immigrants. the two-hour deposition was at least the third time trump had to leave the campaign trail to be deposed by attorneys in one of his organization's many lawsuits. just two weeks before election day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today. trump is running well behind democrat hillary clinton in most polls -- about 5 percentage points behind in the popular vote in realclearpolitics' rolling average of national polls. but if trump were to win, the number of unresolved cases is unprecedented for a presidential candidate, according to political scientists and historians. trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his jupiter, fla., golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. there's a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the mogul's company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for $4 million, saying trump defamed her. another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. if elected, the open lawsuits would  tag along with trump. he would not be entitled to immunity and could be required to give depositions or even testify in open court. that could chew up time and expose a litany of uncomfortable private and business dealings to the public. one trial, over not paying tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city, is set to start a week before election day. even in the waning days of the campaign, in a speech saturday in gettysburg, pa., outlining his first actions if he wins the white house, trump threatened to sue all of the women who've accused him of unwanted sexual advances, saying all of them are lying. the open cases raise questions about potential conflicts of interest that could become difficult for trump to navigate. for instance, could his judicial appointments be influenced by his own court cases? this summer, he attacked a federal judge who is presiding over the lawsuit against trump university, saying district judge gonzalo curiel is biased against trump because the judge is of mexican descent and trump proposes a ""great wall"" along the mexican border. another potential issue: would lawyers, parties in cases and even judges seek to curry favor with a powerful individual in a way that might alter the outcome? irs audit the 'mother of all conflict' norm eisen, who founded the non-partisan watchdog organization citizens for responsibility and ethics in 2003 and later was the top white house ethics lawyer for president obama in 2009 and 2010, ticked off a series of potential conflicts. the lawsuits against trump university could raise questions about whom trump would appoint as education secretary, eisen said. ""somebody with favor to for-profit colleges?"" trump's development of the old post office building in washington is being overseen by the federal government, and lawsuits involving the development could involve government officials. ""will he really put someone in charge that would testify against his business?"" eisen wonders. ""and the mother of all conflict could be the irs audit,"" he said. ""what if they suggest civil penalties, or even criminal proceedings?"" alan garten, general counsel for trump and his business interests, downplayed the significance of the cases. garten said only about 30 significant cases are open. the others are run-of-the-mill cases involving one trump holding or another, frivolous causes or suits destined to be dismissed. ""the reality is we're an operating company. we'll treat all cases the same way if he's elected or not -- and the results shouldn't be different in the eyes of the law."" clinton has her own share of litigation heading toward election day. media groups are suing her trying to get more emails from her private server. they've also argued for the release of deposition videos. the email lawsuit is among about 30 open civil cases clinton faces. in nearly all cases, clinton is named solely in her government capacity, often among a laundry list of other public officials. in a small fraction, as  with the email server, some argue she should be held accountable as a private individual. clinton's campaign staff did not respond to questions. mountain of lawsuits unprecedented usa today network reporters spent more than six months gathering court records in more than 4,000 lawsuits involving trump and his companies. they traveled to courthouses, studied thousands of pages of records and contacted lawyers, litigants and witnesses across the country. for comparison, reporters also pieced together the record of clinton's court cases. the  analysis found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion-dollar real estate lawsuits. the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house. the review shows that trump frequently responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force, not hesitating to use his tremendous wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources. he has repeatedly refused to pay people and small businesses for their work, forcing them to spend time and legal fees if they want to recover their losses. at least 60 lawsuits -- plus hundreds of additional liens, judgments, and other government filings -- documented cases where people accused trump and his businesses of failing to pay them what they were owed for their work. among them: painters, glassmakers, real estate agents, bartenders and hourly workers at trump resorts coast to coast. even his own lawyers. the review also shows trump and his companies have been accused for years of mistreating women. in at least 20  lawsuits, plaintiffs accused trump and managers at his companies of discriminating against women, ignoring sexual harassment complaints and even participating in the harassment themselves. women in those disputes  testified they were fired for complaining. trump's companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the 1980s until as recently as last spring, when new york had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the trump-owned company that owns the trademark boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies. the review found that people who say something trump doesn't like will frequently get threatened with a lawsuit. ""i'll sue you"" was a trump mantra long before ""build a wall."" the analysis, however, showed  he rarely follows through with  threatened lawsuits over people's words and almost always loses when he does. the lone win was a lawsuit against miss pennsylvania  over her claim on facebook that trump's miss usa pageant was rigged. a window  into private places if trump is elected president, it won't change the way his lawsuits are handled. his companies face open cases of sexual discrimination and fraud, unpaid bills and contract disputes. in any of the open cases, litigants would have the right to demand testimony from trump or people close to him. such legal action can -- and often does -- unlock private financial and other records. even if trump broke no laws or committed no wrongdoing, that kind of inside information could be used by political opponents to try to embarrass him or weaken him politically. clinton could face similar challenges in litigation over her refusal to turn over emails from her time as secretary of state. ""it could pose a problem for both sides in the presidency,"" said julian zelizer, a history professor at princeton university. ""they could produce damaging information, and given the partisan environment, any kind of scandal or investigation could be used to stifle a president."" those kinds of tactics have affected  past presidencies. president ulysses grant was among the early commanders in chief beset by scandal. he was forced to testify under oath at the white house in a high-profile federal prosecution of an illegal whiskey running scheme that ensnared some of his closest political associates. grant's testimony helped get his top aide off the hook and further soiled the public perception of his administration. today, he is widely considered one of the least effective presidents in u.s. history. in more modern times, president richard nixon's administration was ensnared by repeated legal woes, scandals, botched cover-ups and ultimately his resignation. bill clinton faced legal issues tied to whitewater, paula jones and  white house intern monica lewinsky. clinton was forced to give a deposition in one sex-scandal case involving jones and later faced an impeachment trial over his relations with lewinsky at the white house. in the latter, clinton became the first sitting president to testify before a grand jury investigating his own conduct, which became a years-long distraction. yet, no president had litigation in the volume of a potential president trump. ""because of the supreme court case related to bill clinton, there's no automatic shield for the president from civil action,"" said samuel issacharoff, a law professor at new york university. ""if he were president and called to testify and hostilities break out in the middle east a court would probably postpone -- but of course it's a major dislocation to be going through these civil trials while he's running an administration."" trump university presents a troublesome case among the many trump lawsuits, the most problematic could be the trump university cases. former students from across the country have sued in two class actions, accusing the school of charging them up to $35,000 and lying about the value of the lessons they would receive. new york attorney general eric schneiderman sued in 2013 and has since described trump university as a ""fraud"" and a ""scam."" while the open cases are civil, some legal scholars raise the prospect that a court could ultimately find trump university or even trump personally liable for fraud. in the worst case, a finding that fraud took place -- even by a civil court -- could provide congress with the grounds to consider impeachment proceedings. ""these claims are different in an important way than most of his other cases,"" said christopher peterson, a law professor at the university of utah. even though the burden of proof would be lower in civil court to prove trump liable for fraud or racketeering, peterson said, ""the evidence that you would use to prove those claims would be interchangeable. it's the same kind of claims that you would get the mob for in a concrete scam."" at a minimum, if the cases go forward, additional testimony by instructors and students about predatory sales tactics would become public. trump already has been deposed about the university. he downplayed his role, but could be called to testify at a trial. if that happens, trump would become the first modern sitting president to do so in open court. bill clinton gave testimony to a grand jury investigating the monica lewinsky scandal in 1998. trump fights  to keep records secret for years, trump's legal team has successfully kept secret much of the financial information disclosed in his court cases. the vast majority of settlement payments trump has made to litigants is secret under non-disclosure agreements. trump's attorneys also regularly ask judges to seal records that come out during the cases, something that is often done for plaintiffs and defendants in civil cases. if trump is elected president, the already immense pressure to release records could escalate even further. ""you don't know what you don't know,"" said katie townsend, litigation director for the reporters committee for freedom of the press, a plaintiff seeking to liberate some of the sealed records. ""either way, these documents would be newsworthy, before or after the election."" already trump's candidacy has prompted court battles to get records in his cases unsealed. in september, a judge ruled against usa today and the new york times in an attempt to unseal court files from trump's 1990 divorce  from his first wife, ivana. district court judge gonzalo curiel ruled over the summer to keep private the video recording of depositions in the trump university cases, partly for fear they would add to the political tint of the case and because transcripts are already available. but in september, trump attorney's lost battles to keep videotapes sealed in cases involving his washington, d.c., hotel and jupiter, fla., golf resort. and a group of journalists are battling to unseal the settlement in a 1983 case tied to the destruction of bonwit tower in  manhattan to make way for trump tower. the suit alleged undocumented polish workers worked off-the-books. the settlement is still secret. a judge ruled against unsealing those records this summer, but the journalist group is appealing. in june, in the days after the deadliest mass shooting in american history, as both presidential candidates and the rest of the nation were coming to grips with the terrorist attack on orlando's pulse nightclub, trump was also being deposed in washington in one of two lawsuits against the chefs, zakarian and andrí©s. the duo wanted no part of the eatery they'd planned to open in trump's luxury hotel in the old post office building just down the street from the white house. their reason: their reputations were  damaged after trump's comments a year earlier branding mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and criminals. as they sought to establish the idea that such statements could be bad for any business, the chef's attorneys asked trump about the fallout for his businesses. they pressed him about whether he thought his words might keep hispanics from going to a restaurant in one of his hotels. trump's response: the election and the attention he's getting for the words he's using are only going to be good for business. ""i'm running for office. i obviously have credibility because i now, as it turns out, became the republican nominee running against, we have a total of 17 people that were mostly senators and governors, highly respected people,"" he said under oath. after explaining the ""very dishonest"" news media distorted his remarks about mexican immigrants, he added: ""i think, you know, most people think i'm right."" his booming popularity would only help a restaurant succeed, he testified. but, he conceded, the comments could turn some hispanic patrons off.

"s. settlement over the volkswagen group emissions scandal, setting into motion a massive vehicle buyback program and green-lighting environmental remediation efforts. judge charles breyer of the u.s. district court in san francisco approved the sweeping agreement between consumers, the u.s. government, california regulators and the german automaker in a written ruling a week after signaling he was likely to sign off. he said the agreement is ""fair, reasonable and adequate."" the settlement comes about a year after volkswagen admitted that it rigged 11 million vehicles worldwide with software to dodge emissions standards. the company is still facing criminal investigations by the u.s. justice department and german prosecutors. the u.s. probe could lead to additional financial penalties and criminal indictments. about 475,000 volkswagen owners in the u.s. can choose between a buyback or a free fix and compensation, if a repair becomes available. buybacks range in value from $12,475 to $44,176, including restitution payments. people who opt for a fix approved by the environmental protection agency will receive payouts ranging from $5,100 to $9,852, depending on the book value of their car. volkswagen will also pay $2.7 billion for environmental mitigation and another $2 billion for clean-emissions infrastructure. and the company has agreed to a $1.2 billion settlement with dealers over the same matter. vw also is negotiating a separate settlement with more than 80,000 owners of 3-liter diesel vehicles fitted with similar software. more than 336,000 of eligible vw owners have registered for the settlement, though they could back out if vw can't come up with a fix. the company has yet to get approval from the environmental protection agency, and if it fails to do so, everyone will be offered the buyback option. vw plaintiffs attorney elizabeth cabraser told judge breyer last week that the deal ""set a land speed record -- probably an air speed record as well."" fewer than 1% of eligible vw owners opted out of the deal before the september deadline. people who did not respond are automatically considered to have taken the offer. about two dozen vw owners objected to the deal during an oct. 18 hearing. most of the ob jections boiled down to complaints over the amount of the payout, while some critics also lambasted the automaker's ""clean diesel"" advertising and purposeful environmental pollution. vw attorney robert giuffra told the judge the deal ""may well be one of the biggest settlements in consumer history"" and represents vw's concerted attempt to make things right",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Judge OKs $15B Volkswagen settlement; Emissions scandal deal 'fair, reasonable and adequate,' he says",10/26/16
" ""zika and other diseases spread by (the aedes aegypti mosquito) are really not controllable with current technologies,"" cdc director tom frieden said. ""we will see this become endemic in the hemisphere."" speaking at the citylab 2016 conference in this southern city, frieden encouraged mayors and city officials in attendance to bolster mosquito-control divisions, public health budgets and outreach to citizens to educate them about the looming threat. frieden said the federal government is hamstrung when responding to public health emergencies such as zika, which can cause devastating birth defects in babies born to women infected while pregnant. he said his agency has cut back on several programs in order to respond to zika, including hiv testing and immunization. ""we had to take money from every state in the country and give it to the states that needed it more for zika,"" frieden said. ""we do the best we can with the cards we're dealt. but this shows how really important it is that there is emergency funding."" the cdc receives a $14 billion annual budget, but congress  allows the agency to use only $2.5 million to respond to emergencies, leading to the drastic cuts in several programs, frieden said. by comparison, frieden had nearly $40 million in emergency funds as commissioner of the new york city health department, he said. the federal emergency management agency, meanwhile, has broad discretion over its $13 billion annual budget. the cdc, however, doesn't have such flexibility. the agency must seek congressional approval anytime it responds to a public health emergency. the result: when zika started reaching the u.s.  this year, the cdc requested an emergency spending bill from congress, but partisan bickering led to a months-long delay before a $1.1 billion bill passed last month. ""when there's an earthquake or a tornado, fema doesn't go to congress and say, 'would you give us money for this?'"" frieden said. ""they have a fund."" frieden also said the best-case scenario for finding a vaccine for zika is ""two to three years"" away. the cdc director did have some encouraging news based on lessons learned in miami-dade county, the first and, so far, only u.s. county to experience local transmission of the virus. frieden said  the wynwood neighborhood of miami was able to remove itself from the active transmission list in part through aerial  spraying",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,CDC warns that the Zika virus is 'not controllable'; Director describes obstacle of limited federal funding,10/26/16
" the russians had occupied shikotan and three neighboring islands in the days after japan surrendered in world war ii. within three years, the russians expelled all 17,000 residents and claimed the islands -- a move japan has challenged without success for more than seven decades. ""we expected to be back soon. i never thought that 71 years later we'd still be waiting,"" said tokuno, 82, a retired  fishermen. like many former residents, tokuno and his family eventually settled in this remote fishing village, close to the occupied islands. now, tokuno, other former residents and their descendants have new hope that they might finally return to their family homes. japanese prime minister shinzo abe is scheduled to meet with russian president vladimir putin in december to discuss a deal for at least a partial return -- half -- of the four islands called the northern territories in japan and southern kurils in russia. in exchange, japan would invest billions of dollars in developing russia's resource-rich far east. a deal could help japan shore up energy supplies and ease ties with its northern neighbor. but it could bring japan into conflict with the u.s., which has sought to punish russia for its annexation of crimea and support for separatists in eastern ukraine. ""the move entails some considerable risks for abe, since tensions between the west and russia are so high at present,"" said james d.j. brown, associate professor of international affairs at temple university's tokyo campus, who has studied the northern territories issue. ""in the longer term, however, closer relations between japan and russia could be valuable to the united states, since it could help draw russia away from its increasingly close strategic partnership with china,"" brown said. the issue has  plagued relations between the two pacific powers. russia declared war on japan in the waning days of world warii and quickly occupied shikotan and its three neighbors -- etorofu, kunashiri and habomai. the closest of those islands is about 2miles from hokkaido, japan's northernmost main island. on clear days, it can be seen from japanese shores. although diplomatic relations were restored in 1956, the dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending the war. a joint declaration in 1965 called for the return of the two smallest islands -- shikotan and habomai -- to japanese sovereignty in the event a peace treaty is signed. but japanese insistence on the return of all four islands has stymied negotiations. the popularity of abe and putin in their home countries plus changing economic conditions could give the  leaders the wiggle room needed to reach a compromise. in a may meeting with putin, abe proposed an eight-point plan for economic cooperation that could include billions of dollars in energy and infrastructure projects in russia's underdeveloped far east. abe has a personal stake in the issue: his father, shintaro abe, failed to get the islands returned when he was japan's foreign minister in the 1980s. putin, who has seen russia's economy suffer from falling oil prices and western sanctions, has signaled a willingness to give up the two small islands under terms of the 1965 declaration",NEWS; Pg. 5A,USA TODAY,"Japan sets sights on isles Russia seized in 1945; Putin, Abe explore deal to settle long impasse over Northern Territories, strengthen ties",10/26/16
" it is with that history in mind, and amid one of the nastiest u.s. elections ever, that hillary clinton begins her closing argument to a bitterly divided america. for all her outreach to progressives on issues like trade and wall street regulation since she launched her bid in april 2015, she's ending her campaign with a direct appeal to republicans by casting her candidacy as not about partisanship but as a referendum on american democracy. during a tuesday speech in florida, clinton said republican donald trump poses a threat to the  constitution with attacks on freedom of speech and the press, the encouragement of violence at rallies and  a proposed religious test for muslim immigrants. ""now his final target is democracy itself,"" she said, referring to trump's comments at the  las vegas debate that he might not accept the results of the  election. yet in her stump speeches, clinton is making clear that her top priority isn't just attacking trump but also the down-ballot republicans she'd like to see replaced by democrats. in recent trips to new hampshire and north carolina, clinton has taken aim at gop sens. kelly ayotte and richard burr for standing by their party's nominee, though some of the most vulnerable republicans -- like ayotte -- have recently sought to distance themselves from the top of the ticket. with polls showing her with a comfortable lead in the final stretch, clinton seeks to run up her margin of victory, anticipating a  divisive atmosphere in congress following the election. the 2010 mcconnell comment about  obama offers a good reminder of the stakes, said robert shapiro, a political science professor at columbia university. ""if that's where we were then, the starting point may well be the same thing unless the election outcome is so lopsided the republicans think they need to be a little bit more conciliatory,"" he said. it's an awkward balancing act, as clinton pivots from attacking incumbent congressional republicans she might ultimately have to work with to making overt gestures to court their base of independent and gop voters in order to bolster her own margins. in new hampshire, for instance, after attacking ayotte, clinton pivoted to her message about unifying the country. ""i'm proud to see americans coming together -- democrats, republicans and independents -- to reject hate and division,"" clinton said at a monday rally. ""we are more than our disagreements, we americans. there is so much more that unites us than divides us. i'm proud to have the support of more than 150 republican leaders in this state who put country before party."" given her high unfavorable ratings, it is imperative clinton makes this case now, according to presidential historians.

" not just to the checkered flag, but to see which team can marshal the best technology. in its 70th year, the pre-eminent auto-racing circuit has become a tech arms race. at the u.s. grand prix here this past weekend, the internet of things, big data, virtual reality, machine learning, 3-d printing, flash storage, predictive analytics and design play integral roles in the success (or failure) of the 22 drivers that compete in 21 races globally each year. the slightest advancement, or tweak, can mean the difference between first place and 10th place -- often the difference of one second. and that's key considering that running an f1 team can cost upwards of $500 million a year. the technology surge also has impacted the future look and feel of consumer models from mercedes amg petronas f1 team, renault sport formula one team and mclaren honda, each of which incorporate changes ranging from hybrid engines to aerodynamic design from its racing operations within a few years. even the steering wheel, which costs up to $35,000 on an f1 car, has evolved for the everyday commuter, with buttons for changing radio stations, monitoring fuel efficiency and navigating streets. ""it's the most technologically-advanced sport on the planet,"" says jonathan martin, chief marketing officer of pure storage, which is relaying dizzying amounts of data between mercedes' pit here and its racing headquarters in brackley, england. f1 is a ""microcosm of the (tech) industry."" advances in car tech mirror what's happening in silicon valley, where tesla motors and google are developing self-driving cars with sophisticated braking systems, and among the major automakers, who are rapidly transforming their machines into oversized computing devices. there is a need for tech efficiency in addition to speed. regulations in the sport change every few years, prompting the 11 competing teams to redesign, engineer and manufacture various car parts. next year, for the first time in more than 50 years, the rules will make for faster speeds on the track with bigger, wider tires. the drivers, to be sure, are as good as ever. but the tech underlying their cars has changed the dynamic of a sport that is wildly popular in europe, asia and south america. perhaps nowhere is the convergence of tech and auto racing more clear than when each car completed one of the 56 laps in sunday's race, won by lewis hamilton of mercedes. each time an f1 car buzzed by its pit at more than 200 mph, it transmitted 12,000 data feeds from its 350 sensors. the data dump was shared and instantly analyzed to assess factors such as brake pressure, car balance and tire performance. inside the garage of the three-time defending champion mercedes team of hamilton and nico rosberg, 60 people monitor their cars' performance while navigating a phalanx of cables, super-charged pcs and thousands of car parts within a confined space. ""this is the guts of the operation behind all the shiny stuff,"" says geoff willis, technology director for mercedes. at times, it all looks like nasa control, with more than 20 computer screens meticulously monitored for every imaginable vital sign emanating from the high-performance cars. paddy lowe, executive technical director of mercedes, has been part of six formula one-winning teams in his nearly 30 years in the sport. during that time, he has seen an evolution in design and innovation that now makes anything conceivable.

""there's no doubt that netflix, amazon and other (over-the-top net tv) services are a challenge for pay-tv operators,"" said tim westcott, senior principal analyst at ihs technology. last year, the only networks outspending netflix and amazon were disney-abc ($11.84 billion), nbc ($10.27 billion) and cbs ($5.7 billion), according to a recent report from ihs markit. even with its dragon-fueled fantasy series game of thrones, hbo spent only $2 billion. networks such as amc and fx do grab viewers with series such as the walking dead and the americans. but netflix and amazon have built their own audiences with original series such as house of cards, orange is the new black and jessica jones (netflix), and transparent, bosch and mozart in the jungle (amazon). and both services plan to keep spending. netflix plans to spend more on developing its own original content as it did with its summer hit stranger things, as opposed to paying other studios, such as sony, which produced the crown, a new series that debuts nov. 4, and disney, which creates luke cage and the other series based on marvel comics characters. netflix remains the leader in more homes, but about one in six (16%) tv viewers supplement their options with another service, such as amazon or hulu plus, market research firm gfk says. that's up from 10% in 2013. the quality of programming on these services has helped foster a steady decline in pay-tv homes. about 800,000 customers are expected to cut the cord over the next 12 months, costing the pay-tv providers as much as $1 billion in revenue, suggests a recent survey by management consultancy cg42. that mirrors findings released last month by magid advisors that as many as 6% of current pay-tv subscribers were ""very likely"" to cut the cord. that's up from 3.8% in its survey last year. the main reason, according to mike vorhaus, president of magid  associates: the growing libraries of quality content available from net tv providers. for now, this is all working out in viewers' favor.

" last week, self-driving truck start-up otto teamed with anheuser-busch to successfully deliver a semi-tractor full of beer from fort collins, through denver and on to the southern colorado city in the shadow of pikes peak. for the majority of that 120-mile trip, the truck's driver left his seat and observed the road from the comfort of the sleeper berth. an otto video of the drive shows the slightly disconcerting image of a massive 53-foot trailer filled with 2,000 cases of bud rumbling down i-25 with no human in the cab. otto's tech is at present confined to highways, and humans take over in city traffic. otto and anheuser-busch, which announced the news tuesday, plan additional real-world autonomous truck drives in the months ahead. ""the initial appeal for us was to see how we could meet the needs of a company like anheuser-busch,"" otto co-founder lior ron tells usa today. ""but now after this successful test, we're eager to see how it will handle other roads and other weather."" the otto landmark stands in stark contrast to the ongoing self-driving car tests by google, uber and ford in california, arizona and other states that require a safety driver to remain at the wheel in case of emergencies. at present, states offer self-driving tech companies a patchwork of laws that, in time, the national highway traffic safety administration is hoping to corral into a cohesive autonomous car policy. in colorado, the department of transportation worked with otto for a number of months evaluating the company's technology and joining on test runs before agreeing to let an otto semi roll along without a driver in the cab. ""safety remained our primary concern, but we believe that in this case the driver is the automated system itself,"" says amy ford, spokeswoman for the colorado dot, whose roadx mission is to partner with innovative companies to help ensure that the state leads the way in the coming transportation revolution. ""we'd like to help get this tech deployed in the real world."" otto, which was founded this year by google car veterans ron and anthony levandowski, was bought by uber last august for $670 million. uber is boosting its self-driving tech initiative with levandowski in charge of leading the ride-hailing giant's charge. the concept behind otto is to produce an aftermarket kit comprised of radar and camera sensors that, when harnessed to proprietary software, will allow the nation's 350,000 owner-operator truckers to keep their trucks on the road longer without cutting into their carefully monitored driving time. otto's -- and uber's -- interest in cornering the trucking market doesn't need much explanation. in 2015, trucking brought in $726 billion in revenue and accounted for 81% of all freight transport, according to the american trucking associations. trucking industry advocates remain concerned about both the technology's ability to decipher every road emergency and the danger of having a driver resting or even sleeping while a truck is at highway speeds. for anheuser-busch inbev, a global spirits juggernaut valued at $213 billion, the appeal of the partnership was to ""see if we could help pioneer technology that will make the jobs of those shipping product easier and safer,"" says james sembrot, senior director of logistics and safety for anheuser-busch. sembrot says the company's beer travels an estimated 450 million miles a year to its various destinations. anheuser-busch doesn't own any trucks, but rather contracts with 300 trucking companies nationwide.

" despite a campaign marked by bigotry, xenophobia and misogyny, and a candidate whose personal character and sexual morality are completely contrary to their professed values, evangelicals are still rallying to trump's side. or so the story goes. but there's a problem with that story. the term ""evangelical"" has become political shorthand for white political conservatives who profess to be evangelicals and vote overwhelmingly for republican political candidates, based almost solely on their opposition to abortion and gay marriage. this characterization erases the voices of tens of millions of americans who fit the theological definition of evangelical, but who do not support such a narrow definition of ""moral issues"" and clearly do not support trump or his bigotry. these evangelicals are african-american, latino, asian-american, native-american and white. they are younger and older, and they are women and men. they are christians who believe in the centrality of christ as savior of humanity and the world, the importance of both conversion and discipleship, the authority of the scriptures and the ""good news"" of the gospel, especially for the poor and oppressed as jesus himself defined it in his opening sermon at nazareth. identity theft thirty-five percent of adults identify as ""evangelical"" or ""born-again,"" according to the pew research center, but only 76% of this group is white. the problem with polls -- like one done by pew that shows trump's support among white evangelicals at 78% -- is that journalists often report the results as ""overwhelming support from (all) evangelical voters."" that is just not the case. for instance, a recent lifeway poll shows support for trump among white evangelicals at 65%, while his support among all evangelicals is only 45%. in reuters polls this month, trump won a similar share of self-described born-again christians. the truth is that most american evangelicals do not support trump. these christians are victims of a sort of identity theft, as the national conversation conflates them with a narrow demographic of mostly older, politically conservative whites. this month, i and other members of this silenced multitude set out to change that. the bigotry of the trump campaign ""strikes at the heart of the gospel"" and is not just another issue, more than 75 evangelical leaders of diverse ages and ethnic backgrounds said in a statement posted at change.org. ""we, undersigned evangelicals, simply will not tolerate the racial, religious, and gender bigotry that donald trump has consistently and deliberately fueled, no matter how else we choose to vote or not to vote,"" we said. integrity of the faith this declaration comes from individual leaders who believe that bigotry must be denounced for the sake of the integrity of the christian faith and the very meaning of the word ""evangelical."" if the mistaken perception persists that evangelicals overwhelmingly support trump in this election, it could mean the obituary of the true meaning of ""evangelical"" in america -- especially for a new generation. as robert jones has expertly documented in his recent book the end of white christian america, the number of older, conservative, white male evangelicals is shrinking each year. meanwhile, the number of younger evangelicals of all ethnic backgrounds -- whose moral and political views extend far beyond positions on gay marriage and abortion -- is on the rise. too many leading conservative white evangelicals (the old stalwarts of the religious right) continue to ignore everything else about trump for the sake of supreme court picks, an anti-gay agenda and proximity to power. but that political strategy is becoming a stretch for a growing number of evangelicals. the embrace by many white evangelicals of a racial and pro-rich politics, which ignores 2,000 bible verses that emphasize god's concern about injustice and the poor, represents worse than bad theology -- it is idolatry bordering on heresy. concern for the vulnerable is at the heart of jesus' life-changing and earth-shattering call. this historic moment, in which a diverse new evangelical generation confronts the immoral bigotry of the trump campaign, is an opportunity to reclaim the true ""evangelical"" identity going forward. and that will indeed be good news for us all. rev. jim wallis is the president and founder of sojourners",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Evangelicals aren't who you think; Contrary to headlines, most are not white conservatives for Trump",10/26/16

" ""i kind of looked at them like, 'oh, cool, death troopers,' and then suddenly stopped and thought, 'hang on a minute, this is my film. i'm never going to be in a position where it's  (again) part of popular culture,'"" says edwards. the dreaded empire hasn't been seen on the big screen since it was upended by luke skywalker and the rebel alliance in 1983's return of the jedi. but with rogue one (in theaters dec. 16) -- featuring a tale that takes place before the events of the first star wars film  of 1977 -- edwards takes the reins of george lucas' bad guys, including the legendary darth vader. the filmmaker blends the fresh and the familiar in rogue one, which focuses on the construction of the weaponized battle station, the death star, and the rebel mission to steal its plans. blocky-winged tie fighters from lucas' original trilogy share space with more aerodynamic tie strikers. and vader looms again as an antagonistic presence alongside director orson krennic, a new imperial officer played by ben mendelsohn (bloodline) and the boss of the darkly colored death trooper squad. because top men in the empire such as grand moff tarkin -- played in the original star wars by peter cushing -- are upper-class types, edwards recalls mendelsohn asking if he should adopt ""a very posh english accent."" but the director preferred krennic, the man in charge of the advanced weapons research wing of the imperial military, not be a part of that boys club. ""it feels like if the empire ever have a job vacancy, they go to the royal shakespeare company to headhunt people,"" edwards says. ""i like the idea that ben's character was much more working-class"" and rose in the ranks ""through sheer force of personality and ideas."" that said, the director adds, krennic ""hits a brick wall in the hierarchy where they won't let him in the club and it's going to turn into a them-or-us situation: either krennic or tarkin and the others."" working with vader, though, was on another level for edwards. voiced again by james earl jones and featuring various  actors inhabiting the old battle armor and helmet, vader is used sparingly in rogue one, yet whenever he power-walked into a scene, everybody around morphed into a 4-year-old, according to the director. ""it's like we're at the playground again and there's this hero sort of standing there,"" edwards says. ""you end up very respectful of him: even though you know there's a guy inside the outfit, you still talk to him like he's vader."" while filming one of krennic's first scenes interacting with the sith lord, in the middle of a take mendelsohn called edwards over, and the director was nervous something was wrong.

" michelle obama, the reluctant campaigner who can't wait to move out of the white house, has suddenly become hillary clinton's secret weapon, capturing headlines with passionate and personal speeches promoting the former secretary of state and castigating her opponent. white house aides say the first lady is more valuable on the campaign trail than even the president -- ""probably the most powerful advocate that secretary clinton has,"" said press secretary josh earnest. just as president obama's effort to get clinton elected has made him the most active lame-duck presidential campaigner in history, historians say michelle obama is perhaps the most active first lady to campaign for someone other than her husband. before clinton -- who is, after all, a former first lady and senator herself -- eleanor roosevelt was the most active first lady in history. sen. john f. kennedy repeatedly courted her for her support in 1960, and when it came it was more in the form of behind-the-scenes advice than public pronouncements. michelle obama, on the other hand, has taken an ever more visible role on the campaign trail, with recent speeches in new hampshire and arizona that garnered national television audiences. she'll appear side-by-side with clinton on thursday in winston-salem, n.c. ""i don't think we've seen anything like this before,"" said kate andersen brower, the author of first women: the grace and power of america's modern first ladies. ""she is a godsend to the clinton campaign."" that's partly because mrs. obama complements clinton's perceived weaknesses. ""michelle is kind of a moral compass,"" brower said. ""she can talk about topics that hillary clinton can't. clinton hasn't really talked about her husband's transgressions in the white house. the obamas don't have that same stain on them."" that's partly because michelle obama has largely been above the fray of partisan politics during the past eight years, choosing to focus on relatively non-controversial causes like nutrition, military families and the rights of young girls around the globe. brower points to what has become michelle obama's signature line of the 2016 campaign. ""when they go low, we go high,"" ""she can say that,"" brower said. at a party fundraiser in california this week, the president said the first lady would just as soon stay off the campaign trail. ""some of you may be aware of the fact that michelle does not really love politics. this was not her first choice for me. she would have preferred a quieter life, a little bit more out of the limelight,"" he said. ""but the passion that she's brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this election is different, the choice is different."" such is her popularity that even donald trump himself -- known for late-night twitter broadsides against gold star families, miss universe contestants and television anchors -- has said barely a word about the first lady, even as she attacks him. ""we have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. his wife, all she wants to do is campaign,"" trump complained last week. michelle obama's approval ratings are head-and-shoulders above clinton's, trump's or even the president's. an august gallup poll put the first lady's approval ratings at 64%, vs. those of the possible candidates to succeed her in the east wing: bill clinton (49%) and melania trump (38%). ""she is somebody who enjoys the deep respect of a large majority of americans,"" earnest said. ""she also is somebody who's a very persuasive speaker, she is somebody who has been able to make a forceful personal case about why she's involved in this election. and yes, i think the president would admit that his wife is an enormously influential and powerful surrogate in support of secretary clinton."" previous first ladies, like barbara and laura bush, maintained high popularity by largely staying above the political fray. michelle obama's approval ratings increased by 6 percentage points after her democratic national convention speech. in that speech, she prosecuted the character argument against trump in a way that only the mother in chief could.

""i would expect it to be very weak,"" economist dan white of moody's analytics says. city and county governments rely largely on property tax revenue, which has climbed along with home values in recent years. states, by contrast, draw 43% of their income from personal income taxes and 31% from sales taxes, says john hicks, head of the national association of state budget officers. sixty-four percent of states surveyed fell short of their projected sales tax collections last month, up from an average 42% during the 7-year-old economic recovery, according to the liscio report, which tracks state finances. and 47% of states took in less than anticipated in personal income taxes withheld by employers, up from a 40% average since the recession. virginia gov. terry mcauliffe recently said the state faces a $1.5billion budget shortfall over the next two years it will partly close by drawing $125 million from raises intended for teachers and state workers. other states -- including massachusetts, new mexico, mississippi and missouri -- are similarly grappling with disappointing income in fiscal 2017, which began july 1 for most states. the budget crunches began in fiscal 2016. state tax revenue fell 2.1% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period and is set to rise a meager 1% in the third quarter, based on preliminary estimates, says don boyd, rockefeller's director of state fiscal policy. typical increase: about 5%. ""it's a very stressed environment that has gotten worse rather than better,"" he says. state spending, in turn, is expected to rise 2.5% in the current fiscal year, below increases of 3.8% last year and 4.2% in fiscal 2015, hicks says. to help cope, illinois recently drained its $275 million rainy day fund to pay for things such as food and medicine in state facilities, leaving the state vulnerable in case of recession. massachusetts chopped $260 million in spending  -- including from medicaid, a kindergarten expansion and state parks -- to help close a $750 million budget hole. reasons for the squeeze personal income taxes. taxes withheld by employers grew 2.7% in the second quarter from a year ago, down from an average 4.1% the previous four quarters, a rockefeller report shows. modest gains in the stock market last year translated into lower capital gains taxes. and job growth has slowed this year, reducing aggregate increases in income and taxes. sales taxes.  low inflation, particularly for oil and gasoline, has curtailed collections, white says. and consumer spending has shifted to services, such as medical care, and online, both of which collect taxes less efficiently than goods providers and brick-and-mortar stores. corporate income taxes. they tumbled 9.2% in the third quarter. corporate earnings have fallen for several quarters as weak revenue combined with rising wages in a tight labor market to narrow profit margins. weakness in oil-producing states. the economies of states such as north dakota and oklahoma were hammered in the oil price crash. at the same time, states' medicaid and pension obligations are increasing. about 8.5% of state and local taxes went to pensions last year, up from 4",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"States' budget woes are hurting consumers; And don't forget the broader economy, where raises for workers and funding for education and parks are getting cut",10/27/16

" in fact, trump has a vision that is both coherent and overdue. the overarching goal is to provide americans with the best return on the tax dollars they pay into the treasury, which should be used by our federal government to carry out constitutional obligations. this approach is a fiduciary duty of our chief executive and in our national interest. ensuring a positive return on taxpayer dollars is more than just an obligation of government; it is the quintessential purpose of government, whether those dollars are spent in the areas of security, prosperity, justice or general welfare. trump's focus  transcends the increasingly fuzzy divide of domestic, foreign and multilateral policies. it is misguided to describe trump's foreign policy on a continuum between isolationism, which is unrealistic, and interventionism, which has been mismanaged into a deplorable waste of american blood and money. instead, he'd consider each foreign engagement or ""entanglement"" on its merits: the costs vs. the expected benefits, with the option to disengage if it's apparent that actual benefits do not justify the costs.  trump's approach is better characterized as favoring smart money over stupid money. and smart money always has a way out of bad deals. while some might  view trump's approach as unilateral, his own statements belie that. he has stated that he is looking for ""fairness."" but he will not tolerate others taking advantage of overly generous (or poorly negotiated) international agreements. although american generosity is one of our defining attributes, and one of which all americans should be rightfully proud, we must not allow our generosity to be treated as naivete or free global goods at the expense of american pre-eminence. american pre-eminence, after all, has been the greatest global good for all. while the most consequential accords deal with security and trade, they are all essentially contracts between or among nations, with diplomats rather than businessmen doing the negotiating. but diplomats are much less experienced with, and interested in, what businessmen and private investors demand in the form of return on investment because the taxpayer-funded treasury is essentially free money to these public sector decision-makers. although the output side of u.s. government functions are not measured in dollar revenue, the costs are measured in taxpayer dollars, and there has been little effort to control costs in achieving our desired international objectives. in sum, the essential promise of the trump doctrine is to set a higher standard of care for our nation and its citizens by treating taxpayer dollars like our own money. after all, we are ultimately spending america's future",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Trump's foreign policy favors U.S. taxpayers,10/27/16

" but this year, we have watched a major candidate for our country's highest office demean and slander whole categories of american citizens. we have watched him make offensive, outrageous claims about real people and real decisions that everyday americans face. people like me. decisions like mine. what sent me to my computer to write is late-term abortion. when i heard donald trump's debate talk about babies being ""ripped"" from their mothers' wombs, my outrage poured down my face in angry tears. in those moments, trump, who has never been pregnant and presumably has come  this far without undertaking any gut-wrenching, gray-area decisions, used my own pain to advance his political agenda. but his words won't tell my story, so i'll tell it here. i don't often speak about this experience. and i've never written about it until now. pregnant with a girl the late-term abortion i chose was the end of a dream. the pain was so real and so consuming that  i never thought i'd have the happy, healthy family that i do today. it was one of the most agonizing experiences of my life and a true lesson in the reality that life is not always as clear-cut and obvious as you might think it is. when my oldest son was a year old, my husband and i got the news that i was pregnant with a second child, a girl. chasing a toddler while juggling a job and all-day sickness was no picnic, but i was excited. i handled most of the doctor's appointments on my own -- i knew the drill. the baby was active and present in family conversations, her big brother slowly acquiring the language of siblinghood, the lively discussion of her name a frequent topic. until ... until ... until one routine appointment toward the end of the pregnancy when the doctor looked at the sonogram images, was silent for too long, then told me to hang on -- she'd be right back. in the moments that followed, one doctor after another entered the exam room, looked at the sonogram screen, then retired to the hallway and whispered conversation. i kept asking what was going on, but nobody would say. as i sat there in the cold company of beeping monitors, my heart beat so fast and i felt so afraid. and then all the doctors came in the room together, stood around the bed, and told me that my baby was severely developmentally compromised; that she would die at birth, if not before, after a very short, excruciatingly painful few minutes of life; and that continuing the pregnancy to full term would be very dangerous for me.

" rising e-commerce sales, growing prime memberships and further expansion of its cloud service aws are expected to provide solid results when the seattle company posts its third-quarter financial results thursday after the markets close. amazon shares closed down 1.51% wednesday to $822.59. analysts polled by s&p global market intelligence anticipate amazon will report revenue of $32.654 billion and a profit of 82 cents per share. that compares with 17 cents in the year-earlier period. amazon's third-quarter guidance was net sales of between $31 billion and $33.5 billion. ""amazon enters the holiday quarter on a roll after strong sales in q3, including an improved prime day in july. growth is likely to easily exceed the 16.1% growth in u.s. retail e-commerce sales,"" emarketer retail analyst yory wurmser said. a usa today analysis this month found that if items from third-party sellers are included, amazon could account for as much as 30% of total u.s. online sales. the company has ramped up its fulfillment centers, adding 18 this quarter. it also has hired 120,000 more workers, 20% more than last year. while that expansion could serve the company well in the crucial fourth-quarter holiday sales season, it also costs money. ""it's significantly more investment, and that's going to put pressure on profitability in the third quarter,"" edward jones analyst josh olson said. however, given amazon's usual workings, ""if they've gauged market demand correctly, it will translate into accelerating growth in their retail business,"" olson said. prime membership continues to grow, according to chicago-based consumer intelligence research partners. amazon itself does not release prime membership numbers, but cirp estimates that there are now 65 million u.s. members, meaning 52% of amazon customers are prime members. that's up from an estimated 47 million u.s. prime members at the end of the september 2015 quarter, an increase of 38% in one year. prime members are very lucrative for the company, spending on average about $1,200 per year, compared to about $600 per year for non-member customers.

""that's a gap that must be closed -- consumers who use the network of the 21st century deserve similar protections,"" he said in a blog post on the fcc site this month. more than nine out of 10 adults (91%) agree or strongly agree consumers have lost control of their personal data and its use, according to a pew research center report out last month.

" one corrupting trend that shouldn't be obscured is the deluge of money going into state judicial races. it's bad enough when the presidential candidates, and those running for everything from congress to state legislatures, are viewed as beholden to special interests. it's even worse when judges -- who are supposed to be the impartial umpires of the legal system -- are seen as owing their jobs to donors. at best, the court system no longer appears fair. at worst, the system no longer is fair. state supreme court judges are on ballots in 27 states this fall and, as of wednesday, outside groups had already broken the record on tv ad spending with $14 million in ad buys. the money has come from all directions: trial lawyers and businesses, liberal and conservative groups, and shadowy organizations that do not have to disclose their donors. this year, exhibit a of excess is the battle in louisiana, where business interests are vying with plaintiffs' trial lawyers to fill a vacancy on the state supreme court.  louisiana landowners often sue oil and gas companies for alleged damage during drilling or exploration, litigation worth tens of millions of dollars to each side. already, more than $785,000 has been spent by just three outside groups, according to the brennan center for justice, an enormous amount for a race in a single judicial district. much of the money comes from groups with opaque names that tend to confuse voters, such as restore our coast,  a political action committee led by local trial lawyers. the virginia-based center for individual freedom, which has spent nearly $500,000 attacking the candidate supported by the lawyers, does not have to disclose its donors. but, according to the center for responsive politics, it has received money from a conservative group founded by republican strategist karl rove and another conservative group, which in turn has gotten donations from energy interests. the republican state leadership committee, which at least has a more revealing name, is so far the biggest outside spender nationwide on judicial races, with a total of $4 million in tv ad buys and donations to other  groups. it's all part of a 15-year trend in which state judicial elections have acquired all the ugly trappings of other  campaigns. even president obama has gotten in on the act, endorsing a democrat seeking to unseat a republican supreme court justice in north carolina, where republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. of the various ways that states choose judges, including appointment and merit selection, partisan elections have to be the worst. if states use that method, they should at least adopt publicly financed campaigns in which the candidates do not end up beholden to anyone except the general public. but only two states, new mexico and west virginia, are using this sensible system",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Big-money judicial races taint the legal system,10/27/16

" amid a disquieting increase in overall u.s. traffic fatalities, the national highway traffic safety administration has tracked an upswing in the percentage of drivers testing positive for illegal drugs and prescription medications, according to federal data released to usa today and interviews with leaders in the field. the increase corresponds with a movement to legalize marijuana, troubling experts who  readily acknowledge that the effects of pot use on drivers remain poorly understood. recreational marijuana use is now legal in colorado, washington state, oregon, alaska and the district of columbia, even as it remains outlawed on a federal level. five states -- arizona, california, maine, massachusetts and nevada -- are set to vote on legalization. it's ""very probable"" that colorado's move to legalize recreational marijuana has caused an increase in fatal crashes, said glenn davis, the state's highway safety manager. in 2015, 21% of the 31,166 fatal crashes in the u.s. involved at least one driver who tested positive for drugs after the incident -- up from 12% in 2005, according to nhtsa. the rate rose in 14 of the past 15 years, falling for the first time last year. it was down less than 1 percentage point compared with 2014. ""drugs is emerging as a higher number,"" said mark rosekind, administrator of the national highway traffic safety administration. a separate federal study of 11,000 weekend, nighttime drivers found 15.1% tested positive for illegal drugs in 2013 and 2014, up from 12.4% in 2007. marijuana represented the largest increase, as 12.6% tested positive in 2013 and 2014, up from 8.6% in 2007. researchers caution that the connection between drugs and deadly crashes is not as significant as the effect of drunken driving, which is responsible for more than 30% of road fatalities. experts also note that available data is not comprehensive -- and some drugs, including certain over-the-counter medications, have no effect on the driver. many drivers who get high and then get behind the wheel are subject to arrest for driving under the influence just as  those who drink and drive. one victim, according to prosecutors, was david aggio of california. he was killed march 8, 2014, when rodolfo alberto contreras, who was high on marijuana, ran a red light at nearly 80mph, crossed the center divider and demolished aggio's ford explorer, prosecutors said. contreras in june became the first drugged driver in california to be convicted of second-degree murder. according to california prosecutors, his response at the scene of the crime, when confronted about the incident, was: ""i want my weed."" he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. auto-safety experts are particularly concerned about a spike in drugged driving in states that have legalized recreational marijuana, such as colorado, where voters approved it in 2014. the nation's opioid epidemic could also be a contributing factor. in 2015, 12.4% of fatal crashes in colorado involved a driver who tested positive for cannabis alone, up from 8.1% in 2013,  the colorado department of transportation reports. the number of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for any drug hit a record 18.6% in colorado in 2015, up from a low of 12.3% in 2012. marijuana proponents dispute the suggestion that pot use is killing more people on the road. jolene forman, staff attorney at the drug policy alliance, which supports marijuana legalization, cautioned against drawing conclusions on the effect of marijuana legalization on drivers. ""we're interested in pursuing policies that advance what  is empirically shown, rather than knee-jerk, fear-based policies,"" forman said. ""it's too soon to say that it's had a positive or negative effect but preliminary data look very promising. it looks like marijuana legalization has not led to road safety concerns."" complicating matters is that research on the effects of drugged driving is scarce, leaving road-safety experts with little understanding of the full ramifications. for starters, many drivers involved in fatal crashes aren't tested for drugs. what's more, just because drivers have drugs in their system doesn't mean they are impaired. marijuana is noticeable in the bloodstream for weeks, but its strongest effects dissipate after a few hours. in addition, there's no generally accepted field sobriety test for officers to conduct, and there's no standard level of impairment for marijuana. in contrast, all states punish drivers for blood-alcohol concentration at or above 0.08%, according to the governors highway safety association. but a study released in june by the university of iowa's national advanced driving simulator (nads) concluded that drivers with blood concentration of 13.1ug/l (grams per 1,000 liters) of the main active ingredient in marijuana, thc, ""showed increased weaving that was similar to those"" with 0.08 blood-alcohol level. ""as we see more people drive on the road with different controlled substances, whether they be illicit or prescription drugs, the risk is increasing,"" said tim brown, associate research scientist at nads and co-author of the study, in an interview. anyone who's driving dangerously because they're high can be flagged by officers who are looking for drunken drivers, said j.t. griffin, chief government affairs officer for mothers against drunk driving",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,A spate of drugged driving deaths alarms U.S. regulators; Wider legalization of pot considered factor,10/27/16

""horizontal"" mergers involve two competing companies, such as american airlines and us airways. they generally work well for the bottom line. at some point, though, an industry becomes too consolidated and the anti-trust authorities stop allowing these acquisitions. the other type, known as ""vertical"" mergers, involves companies in adjacent industries up and down the supply chain, such as an oil company buying refiners and gas stations. the proposed acquisition of time warner is this kind of deal. at&t distributes digital content thorough its land line and wireless networks, and through directv, the satellite television company it bought last year. time warner generates digital content through hbo, cnn, the warner bros. movie studio and other channels. the at&t bid warrants careful regulatory scrutiny, particularly to ensure that time warner content doesn't get preferential treatment. but frankly, our first impression of the deal is that it is unlikely to change much for consumers. time warner used to have a distribution arm, a company that was spun off as time warner cable in 2009. if this kind of vertical integration was such a bad thing for consumers (and a good thing for corporate profits), time warner never would have parted ways with its cable system. the merger of comcast and nbc universal is instructive. it is widely viewed as successful in that comcast's stock has done fairly well since the deal concluded in 2013. it has not, however, resulted in reduced competition, or comcast forcing people to get their news from nbc. our problem with the at&t-time warner deal is that it appears to be one more instance of an industry trying to stave off the inevitable. with the possible exception of sports programming, the era of television as something distinct from internet video is coming to an end",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,AT&T-Time Warner deal is just the latest sign of denial,10/28/16

" it would also help assure that hillary clinton becomes the next president of the united states. you might wonder what the world series has to do with politics. that must mean you haven't heard of the so-called world series presidential predictor, according to which a world series win by the national league team presages a win by the democratic candidate for president. an american league victory, in contrast, leads to a republican electoral win. this predictor dates at least  to the early 1970s. that's when the society for american baseball research (sabr) published an article reporting that the predictor had a perfect record over the five presidential elections from 1952 through 1968. as is so often the case, however, a funny thing happened on the way to the bank after this pattern's existence was reported: since then, the predictor has failed on a number of occasions. bill staples jr., a sabr member, recently reported that, based on all world series since they were first held over a century ago, the predictor's track record is statistically no better than a coin flip. this is a valuable lesson for investors since more alleged patterns have been ""discovered"" in the stock market than even in baseball. in almost all cases, those stock market patterns turn out to be worthless. psychologists tell us that this in large part is because our brains are hardwired to ""detect"" patterns even when none exists. and with thousands of us mining the same historical data, it's hardly surprising that a few patterns will emerge that -- like the world series predictor -- look uncannily accurate but in fact are bogus. there are two steps investors should take to protect themselves from following such patterns. the first is to test their accuracy over different time periods than those used to initially ""discover"" their alleged existence. upon doing that, most patterns disappear. had this step been followed in the early 1970s, the world series predictor would never have been proposed, since its ""discovery"" was based on the outcome of just the five previous presidential elections. if its author had considered all other elections as well, the pattern would never have emerged. most of the patterns on which wall street focuses fail this simple test from statistics 101. the second step investors should take to protect themselves from a bogus pattern is to insist that there be a plausible explanation for why it should exist in the first place. if none can be found, odds increase that the pattern is fictional -- even if it is able to survive the first step. needless to say, the world series predictor is unable to satisfy this second step, since there is no credible theory for why the outcome of a baseball playoff has anything to do with who wins a presidential election. perhaps the best illustration of this in the investment arena comes from david leinweber of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory. several years ago he searched through all the data on a united nations cd data disk to find the indicator with the most statistically significant correlation with the s&p 500 index. his discovery: butter production in bangladesh. it's easy for us to see that bangladeshi butter production levels are of no real help to our u.s. stock market investments. but the same goes for most other alleged patterns on which we otherwise focus. the bottom line? there are no magic keys that can unlock the stock market's secrets. the only people who reliably make money when we trade on bogus patterns are the brokers who earn a commission each time we buy or sell. mark hulbert, founder of the hulbert financial digest, has been tracking investment advisers' performances for four decades. for more information, email him at mark@hulbertratings.com or go to www.hulbertratings",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,World Series strikes out as a reliable predictor of elections,10/28/16
" it won't be the last. the six-second video platform, scooped up by twitter in late 2012, seemingly disappeared as fast as its videos. it was part of the carnage thursday when the ailing micro-blogging service said it would lay off 350 people, or 9% of its workforce. twitter said vine, which had 100 million people watching videos each month, would be shut down ""in the coming months."" it should come as no surprise really. the tech industry is littered with dozens of mergers that looked good on paper but didn't translate to real-world markets. tech mergers often flop. the concept of melding two large, disparate organizations and cultures flawlessly is akin to adding a third leg. overhead costs and logistical nightmares further diminish chances for success. ""it's an axiom in the (venture capital) business that 90% of acquisitions or mergers fail to achieve the stated objectives,"" says stewart alsop, a partner in alsop louie partners, a venture capital firm in silicon valley. examples abound. microsoft-nokia. yahoo-tumblr. news corp.-myspace. google-motorola. aol-netscape. yahoo-broadcast.com (sorry, mark cuban). and don't forget the granddaddy of them all, aol-time warner. it badly scarred both media giants for years. ""there are a lot of reasons for failure: some acquisitions are ego-driven, there is a misunderstanding of technology purchased, management changes,"" says rakesh agrawal, an analyst at redesign mobile. it can leave you slack-jawed. and yet in their pursuit of a merger that blows up (in a good way), leaders of silicon valley companies and beyond can't always find the perfect match of a google-youtube or ebay-paypal. many companies flush with cash -- especially large ones such as apple, google and oracle -- are  reacting to fast-moving markets, and they're willing to overpay to play catch-up in emerging tech areas such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. sometimes,  deals are made in haste to block rivals. it's a risky, imperfect art, similar to what baseball general managers go through when they pursue  free agents. when twitter closed in on acquiring vine, some referred to the latter as ""instagram for video."" (facebook bought instagram for $1 billion in 2012.) mergers-and-acquisitions are likely to accelerate as private companies get older, absent the possibility of an ipo (ride-hailing service lyft is reportedly pursuing buyers), and larger companies continue to eye promising start-ups in emerging markets",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Vine won't be last tech buy to fizzle; Conditions, cash, competition collide",10/28/16

""we see a significant opportunity to increase growth as we continue to improve the core service,"" dorsey said in a statement. ""we have a clear plan, and we're making the necessary changes to ensure twitter is positioned for long-term growth."" that said, analysts say a takeover could still be in the cards. ""we see twitter aggressively experimenting with its product, and that's the right thing to do,"" rbc capital markets analyst mark mahaney said. ""but we continue to believe an m&a exit is plausible, just not  in the near term nor near current valuation."" the service known for its 140-character messages has struggled to broaden its mainstream appeal and bring in advertising dollars while the fortunes of established competitors such as facebook have soared and newer entrants such as snapchat and facebook-owned instagram have quickly gained traction. snapchat, the messaging service run by los angeles company snap, is planning an initial public offering in 2017 that could raise billions of dollars and bring a heady valuation of up to $40 billion. twitter, on the other hand, is being forced to retrench, discontinuing its vine mobile app and launching its second round of cuts after it let go 8% of its workforce a year ago. the money-losing company said it's targeting profitability in 2017. layoffs will come from sales, marketing and partnerships, leading to what chief financial officer anthony noto called a ""meaningful change"" in margins. ""once a company gets to our scale and growth, it is appropriate to work toward profitability,"" noto said. sales and marketing costs, about 30% of revenue, could be reduced to between 22% and 26%, he said. twitter said it expects the restructuring to rack up cash costs of $10 million to $20 million, in addition to stock-based compensation expense of $5 million to $10 million. most of the charges would come in the fourth quarter. ""twitter is overstaffed for the revenue it generates, relatively speaking. it has far more people working on a far smaller and less complex product than facebook does. so some cuts make sense,"" said jan dawson, chief analyst with jackdaw research. ""but it makes you worry about their ability to achieve their goals around improving the product, cutting down on abuse and ultimately driving growth."" executives say increasing daily usage and engagement on twitter were boosted by live-streamed broadcasts of nfl games and the presidential election debates. twitter did not say how many daily active users it has. the number of people who use the service at least once a month increased 1.7% to 317 million from the second quarter. that significantly lags facebook, which has 1.71 billion users, and instagram, which has 500 million. twitter executives are betting on live-streaming video, not just to bring more users to the service, but to lift advertising revenue, too. morgan stanley estimated the nfl deal would generate $11 million in additional ad revenue in the fourth quarter. third-quarter revenue rose 9% to $616 million, marking the smallest gain since twitter went public three years ago and the ninth consecutive quarter of declining growth but still beating expectations of $605.5 million. ad revenue accounted for $545 million, up 6% year-over-year. twitter posted a net loss of $103 million in the third quarter, less than the $131.7 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Twitter cuts jobs, Vine as it seeks profitability; Social media network to slash 9% of workforce as it looks toward 2017",10/28/16

" let that serve as a welcome reminder to anyone feeling overwhelmed by the increasingly grim attitude that dominates the tv drama landscape. for every sweet moment of uplift you get from nbc's this is us, it seems, you get a hundred blows to the head from a barbed-wire bat -- literally on the walking dead, figuratively elsewhere. what a relief, then, to find amazon's good girls revolt (friday, *** out of four), an inspiring 10-episode series set in 1969 that follows some young female journalists as they fight for equal rights. laced with humor and likeable leads, this is a show with a few good guys (most of them women) and a few hidebound guys (all men) -- but no flat-out villains. the bad guy here is a traditional view that relegated women to being subservient to men, and anyone who knows anything about the late '60s knows that tradition was about to be challenged. in this case, we also know in general how it turns out. good girls is based on lynn povich's book about the successful lawsuit she and other newsweek employees filed to force the magazine to provide equal opportunities to women. as an onscreen warning will advise you, however, the show is only ""inspired by real events,"" not wed to them. so while victory in general may be assured, victory for these individual, fictionalized women is not. the story here is told through the eyes of three young women at news of the week, where women  (habitually referred to as either ""girls"" or ""ladies"") can be researchers but not writers. patti (genevieve angelson) is a budding feminist; cindy (erin darke) is a wife whose marriage is beginning to chafe; and jane (anna camp) is a prim virgin who follows the rules. one of the nice things about this series from dana calvo and darlene hunt is that rather than sidelining the ""prim virgin"" to the ash heap of social history, she's allowed to be smart, competent and more ambitious than she initially appears. the women work for the male reporters to whom they're  assigned -- a relationship that's always sexist and often sexual. patti works for doug (hunter parrish); cindy works for ned (michael oberholtzer); jane works for sam (daniel eric gold) -- and they all work for the editor, finn (chris diamantopoulos). that just seems to be the way of things, until the system is challenged by a new employee -- nora ephron (grace gummer), one of the show's real-life characters. her action eventually  leads them all to another real-life character, eleanor holmes norton (joy bryant), and  an eeoc suit. but not quickly. like most cable and streaming series, good girls takes its time. still, it's time generally well-spent, and not just on the show's primary issue, but on other conflicts of the '60s that come into play. and while every piece of clothing, music and office equipment may not be true to the 1969 time frame, the show accomplishes the main task of a series set in the past: it creates a sense of place, where the clothes and rooms feel lived in and the problems feel real, rather than just heightened examples of the decade's issues. as for how those issues play out, it's important to remember that good girls is not a documentary, so you can't expect complete fidelity to the past or to povich's book. even so, it has incorporated real people into its story, and it owes them a treatment that is essentially true to who they were and what they did",LIFE; Pg. 5D,USA TODAY,Drama inspires with tale of nasty women rebellion; 'Good Girls Revolt' charts equal-rights case at magazine,10/28/16

" it's only september, but already the temperature is below freezing, and the precipitation is coming down as a blizzard of snow. the wind is a piercing 50 knots. the sea is a snarl of huge waves. in short, it's a miserable day. but for students of polar history such as les williams, 67, of duncan, british columbia, it's all part of the experience of a voyage into the northwest passage -- the fabled arctic sea route between the atlantic and pacific. king william island is roughly halfway through the icy waterway, and it was not far from its shore, in 1846, that british explorer john franklin's legendary expedition in search of the crossing ran into its own sort of misery, with ice closing in around his two ships. he and his 128 men were never seen again. ""this weather gives you a little taste of what those explorers were up against,"" williams says. chartered by tour company adventure canada, the 198-passenger vessel is one of a growing number of expedition cruise ships carrying intrepid travelers such as williams into the northwest passage, which cuts through the maze of frozen islands at the top of canada. until the past decade or so, traveling through this area remained almost as daunting as it was during franklin's time. but rapidly shrinking ice coverage across the arctic, driven by climate change, is  making it more accessible. this year alone, nearly half a dozen expedition ships have sailed into the passage, some of them multiple times. the waterway also recently saw its first giant cruise ship, the 1,070-passenger crystal serenity. like most of the vessels, the ocean endeavour isn't making a full transit. flying deep into the arctic on a chartered airplane, passengers board the ship in kugluktuk, an inuit community toward the western end of the passage. the vessel then heads east in the direction of greenland. a typical cruise it isn't. in place of broadway-style shows and decktop amusements, there are  lectures on polar bears and climate change and the local inuit culture. the ""ports"" are forlorn, windswept islands that as often as not are covered in thick snow. bundled-up is the dress code. still, these aren't typical cruisers. these passengers, most of them  from canada and the united states, are willing to endure sometimes harsh conditions to experience one of the world's last great wild places. as is common with expedition ships, the ocean endeavour carries motorized rubber boats for exploring, and nearly every day of the two-week voyage brings some sort of adventure. the trip kicks off with a landing along victoria island, where boggy fields of lichen-covered rocks and low-lying grasses are typical of the region. there is an austere beauty to the place, which passengers soak in during long hikes led by guides carrying rifles for protection against polar bears. this far north, nothing grows more than a few inches off the ground, and wildlife is sparse. one group spots the white ball of fluff that is the arctic hare; another comes across a huge tundra swan. the massive mammals of the arctic remain elusive, though not for long. continuing eastward, the ship soon has its first encounter with that king of the north, the polar bear. a guide spots a single male lounging on a football-field-size piece of ice. as the ship maneuvers closer, the giant marine mammal turns to the vessel, seemingly posing for photos. dozens of cameras fire as if they are one. seeing the arctic's  wildlife -- not just polar bears but arctic fox, narwhals and muskox -- is high on the agenda, but so too are historic sites related to early explorers. at beechey island, where franklin spent the winter of 1845, passengers gaze somberly at the graves of three of his men. at somerset island, they view a cairn built by his would-be rescuers. originally built in 1982 as a baltic ferry, the ocean endeavour is a somewhat basic if functional vessel. still, whatever it lacks in style is more than made up for in the programming offered on board. the ship sails with a stunning array of arctic specialists, many leaders in their field. offering as many as four lectures a day, they include mark mallory, one of canada's top biologists; arctic filmmakers julia szucs and steve smith; and circumpolar archaeologist latonia hartery. the northwest passage isn't all passengers see. emerging from the canadian arctic, the ocean endeavour crosses baffin bay to the mountainous west coast of greenland. sailing past huge icebergs shorn from the greenland ice sheet, the vessel arrives at such colorful arctic settlements as ilulissat -- home to an iceberg-jammed fjord that is a marvel of the north. it's a fitting end to an arctic adventure relatively few have done.

" 9 to find voters in their states have abolished longstanding marijuana prohibitions, a three-fold expansion for legal cannabis across the country. an additional 24 million americans could find themselves in states with newly legal medical marijuana use, a smaller but still significant expansion of legalized pot around the united states. already, half of the states permit some form of medical marijuana use, and more than half of all americans live in a state that has approved medical marijuana. california, experts say, will likely play the most significant role in cannabis legalization on nov. 8. voters in our most populous state are widely expected to approve the ""adult use of marijuana act,"" adding nearly 40 million names to the list of people who live in a state with legal pot. lawmakers see marijuana taxes as a source of new revenue to close budget gaps, while entrepreneurs are considering the business case, with potentially billions of dollars in profits possible from this fast-growing made-in-america industry. arizona, california, maine, massachusetts and nevada are considering legalizing recreational marijuana. voters in arkansas, florida, montana and north dakota are asking voters whether to permit medical use for certain conditions, such as cancer or chronic pain. none of those votes will change the federal ban on marijuana use, although legalization advocates say it may further pressure congress, the dea and the fda to act. four states -- colorado, oregon, washington and alaska, plus the district of columbia -- have already legalized recreational marijuana. an additional 25 permit medical use. but this election has the potential to dramatically shift the conversation because so many americans live in the nine states where relaxation measures are being considered. if it were its own country, california alone would have the world's sixth-largest economy, and what happens there almost inevitably spreads east. polls nationally show growing support for marijuana legalization. a poll released earlier this month by the pew research center found 57% of adults think marijuana use should be legal, up from 53% last year and 32% in 2006. that despite the fact that marijuana remains a schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal at the federal level. a gallup poll released oct. 19 showed even stronger support: 60%, up from 58% last year and 50% in 2011. ""there's been an enormous shift in public opinion on this issue, and i think that has directly led to why it is appearing on so many state's (ballots) this year,"" said john kagia, executive vice president of industry analytics for new frontier data. ""this is going to be an enormous industry, no matter how you slice it."" colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, with voters approving the measure in 2012 and sales launching in january 2014. that vote came after the country already had more than a decade of experience with medical marijuana, a deliberate strategy on the part of  backers who say they started with medical marijuana first before seeking to broaden it. no state has yet legalized recreational marijuana via its legislature. critics say there's insufficient evidence to back the health claims made by medical marijuana supporters. they worry widespread legalization opens the door to big tobacco-style companies interested in selling drugs to the public, especially kids, without regard for the public health consequences. new frontier, which doesn't take a position on legalization, estimates the legal cannabis market could be worth nearly $8 billion by 2020. still, entrepreneurs -- particularly in california -- are rushing to fund greenhouses, invest in growing and harvesting technology and create social media platforms to connect buyers with cannabis recommendations. those investments are targeted at medical marijuana, which is already legal, but the rush shows how investors are positioning themselves for what's widely considered a slam-dunk recreational legalization vote in california. ""people are beginning to understand that this isn't just about not putting people in prison, but about making a lot of money,"" said jeffrey zinsmeister, the executive vice president of the anti-legalization group smart approaches to marijuana, which has funded opposition campaigns in several states. recreational arizona prop. 205 would legalize adult recreational marijuana use, cultivation and sales, with a 15% sales tax to fund new state regulation, enforcement and education efforts. a recent arizona republic/morrison/cronkite news poll found 50% of registered voters favor legalization, 40% oppose it and 10% were undecided. the poll surveyed 784 registered voters between aug. 17 and aug. 31, with a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. since that poll, however, voters have been bombarded with ads. polling expert mike o'neil said he expects the ""no on prop 205"" ads will draw undecided voters to their side. ""at a very simplistic level, it's 'drugs are bad' against 'gee, we're overkill with respect to marijuana,'"" o'neil said. ""anytime you're proposing something new, it's easy to scare people, and when in doubt ... (people) just vote no."" california the california plan, known as the adult use of marijuana act, allows residents to grow up to six plants at home and gives municipalities the power to allow or ban outdoor grows and marijuana stores. it requires commercial growers to comply with environmental regulations -- many illegal growers today ignore laws governing water, pesticide and fertilizer use -- and gives existing medical-marijuana providers a head start in getting business licenses. the measure also maintains existing prohibitions on youth use and driving while high. critics worry it will open up television advertising to marijuana companies and goes too far in permitting people previously convicted of violent drug offenses to join the industry. medical marijuana is widely available in california, and a large portion of the economies of humboldt county and the far northern portions of california are heavily dependent on illegal growing. ""auma is not the best initiative, but it's way better than the status quo,"" said lanny swerdlow, a registered nurse and director of the palm springs-based marijuana anti-prohibition project. ""it's a template, something to build on."" polls show it's likely to pass. maine the ballot measure expands the state's well-regarded medical marijuana program to recreational use, but it also permits the creation of ""marijuana social clubs,"" where people would be able to consume marijuana. critics worry that might increase the amount of impaired driving, in the way that bars can lead to more drunken drivers on the road. there's also concern that the measure requires marijuana-focused publications to be sold from behind store counters, a proposal that was struck down as unconstitutional in colorado. gov. paul lepage signed maine's medical marijuana law in 2011, but he opposes this recreational legalization effort. massachusetts most of the state's political establishment opposes the measure to legalize recreational marijuana, with former governor bill weld one notable exception. weld, a republican, is running on the libertarian presidential ticket with gary johnson. current gov. charlie baker argues legalizing marijuana in the bay state could increase youth use and distract regulators and public health officials wrestling with an epidemic of opioid abuse and overdoses. despite that top-level opposition, voters appear poised to approve the measure. fifty-five percent of likely voters now say they favor legalization for recreation, wbur radio reported. that poll found that half the people surveyed had tried marijuana at some point in their lives. nevada a year after its medical-marijuana program launched, nevada's voters are now considering whether to legalize recreational growing and use. nevada's program would be open to anyone visiting the state, and supporters say the tourist-heavy market could be worth $390million, with up to $1.1 billion in economic impact. medical dispensaries would be granted an 18-month monopoly on recreational sales, and alcohol distributors would also have an 18-month monopoly on distribution. home growing would be banned anywhere within 25miles of a licensed dispensary, which could make home cultivation illegal for up to 90% of the state. the latest polling showed more than 55% of people approved of the measure. critics complain that the ballot measure was largely written and funded by those who stand to benefit the most from legalization. medical arkansas arkansas voters in 2012 nearly legalized medical marijuana, rejecting the measure 51% to 49%, and this year they're considering two competing measures, both of which are opposed by the state's republican-dominated political establishment. as in many states, arkansas voters who are personally familiar with medical marijuana use are more likely to support legalization, especially if they have experience with people who have struggled with opioid use or abuse. medical marijuana advocates say cannabis is a safer alternative to potentially deadly and physically addictive prescription drugs like oxycontin. ""i have a cousin who suffers from lupus,"" said deb sanders, a grandmother from mountain home who supports legalization. ""she smoked some marijuana. she said she could not believe how much better she felt. ... she stopped hurting, her anxiety attacks went away. she doesn't do it recreationally, she only does it when she absolutely has to. her condition has gotten so much better since she introduced into her regimen. she's been able to get off some of her synthetic medications."" florida florida's proposed amendment 2 would allow patients to obtain marijuana if they have ""debilitating"" illnesses, such as cancer, hiv, post-traumatic stress disorder, parkinson's disease and epilepsy. under existing state law, only patients with certain medical conditions that benefit from non-euphoric strains of cannabis and patients with irreversible ""terminal"" illness may access the drug through state-approved doctors and growers. a proposal in 2014 to broadly legalize medical marijuana won nearly 58% of the vote but fell short of the required 60% needed for adoption. polls indicate the measure may have enough support this time around. ""most of the polls, in most of the states, most of the time, show more people in favor than against, but in none of the states are the margins so significant that we feel comfortable,"" said ethan nadelmann, the executive director of the drug policy alliance, an advocacy group backing marijuana legalization throughout the country. ""and there's opposition money that's starting to emerge."" montana this may be the second time voters here approve a medical marijuana plan. they approved one in 2004, but lawmakers in 2011 repealed it and replaced it with a far more restrictive system -- a move that was upheld by the montana supreme court earlier this year. now, initiative 183 aims to restore much of the original system, including allowing providers to hire employees to cultivate, dispense and transport medical marijuana. the initiative also repeals the requirement that physicians who provide certifications for 25 or more patients annually be referred to the board of medical examiners and bars law enforcement from making unannounced inspections of medical marijuana facilities. north dakota north dakotans are considering permitting medical marijuana for certain conditions, such as cancer or ptsd. acknowledging the state's rural nature, patients who live more than 40 miles from a ""compassionate care center"" would be allowed to grow up to eight plants as long as they notified local law enforcement in advance. contributing: phil drake, great falls (mont.) tribune; corinne kennedy, the (palm springs, calif.) desert sun; frank gluck, the (fort myers, fla.) news-press; josh dooley, the (mountain home, ark",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,84 million might be under new pot laws; 9 states consider legalizing medical or recreational use,10/28/16
" the frenzied post-thanksgiving shopping experience that traditionally draws turkey-satiated shoppers out of the house before dawn for  years sparked long lines, bustling crowds and fever-tossed shelves. but in the past two holiday seasons, black friday lost its title as the busiest shopping day of the year. with competition from e-commerce, along with doorbuster specials offered earlier in the month, and selling on thanksgiving day itself, shoppers discovered they don't have to wait for black friday to grab a  deal. experts have noticed the fall-off in foot traffic on black friday. consulting firm deloitte says its researchers, sent out to gauge shopper interest on black friday, have been saying ""is it supposed to be this dead?"" over the past couple of years, says rod sides, vice chairman of the u.s. retail & distribution practice leader. ""it's interesting how much traffic has fallen off in the last three or four years around that particular event, and on that particular day.'' the black friday shopping marathon surged in the 1980s, and over the years retailers opened their doors earlier and earlier, leading to the now common starting time of 6 a.m., says scott bauer, the lead of pwc's digital retail practice. it became the biggest shopping day of the year. but, in 2014, the saturday before christmas surpassed black friday in actual sales. in 2015, ""super saturday'' once again was the top shopping day of the year. and this year, with christmas falling on a sunday, the friday before is poised to potentially usurp both black friday and super saturday when it comes to sales, according to the national retail federation. black friday net sales in store have been in decline, according to analytics firm retailnext. sales dropped 1.6% last year as compared to 2014, and declined 14.1% in 2014 from the previous year. traffic also took a dip, dropping 1.8% in 2015 vs. the previous year, and 16% in 2014 as compared to 2013. but while it trails cybermonday, black friday revenue from online sales continues to grow, increasing from $1.39 billion in 2012 to a projected $3.05 billion this year, according to adobe digital insights. the recent trend of retailers opening their doors on thanksgiving day has  had an impact on black friday's selling power. macy's, for instance, will open at 5p.m. on thanksgiving, an hour earlier than last year. but some stores and malls are  closing on thanksgiving, in part, because the extra shopping day was dimming some of black friday's gleam. ""there is no question that heavy discounting early in the holiday sales season, both online and in stores, along with retailers opening their doors on thanksgiving day have cut into black friday sales,'' says ana serafin smith, spokeswoman for the national retail federation. ""however, black friday remains the official kickoff to the holidays and an important tradition for millions of shoppers across the country. there is no indication that will change in the foreseeable future.'' the move away from starting black friday on thanksgiving is growing. deals are popping up as early as october. amazon starts offering black friday deals next week on nov 1. and this year, lord & taylor will kick off its black friday promotions the tuesday before thanksgiving, while gilt will have online promotions that begin on wednesday. but for many, a traditional black friday still delivers",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Is Black Friday dead?,10/28/16

" its usefulness might turn out to be. apple added a novel touch-strip above the keyboard on its new macbook pros, an expected flourish to the 13- and 15-inch laptops. i'm impressed by how versatile this retina-quality, multitouch strip of glass appears to be and how much third-party support the touch bar is getting. a quick explainer: touch bar supplies dynamic shortcuts to the controls, sliders, menus and tools that relate to the task at hand, so they appear and disappear as needed. as you tap, swipe or drag the touch bar keys, you see the results of your actions on the macbook pro's full-size retina displays. pros: many uses if you're in the messages app, for example, you might use the touch bar to scroll through and choose emojis, which show up on the strip. if you're listening to music, you'll find the play controls there. and if you're editing in photos, you can scrub through images and apply filters or rotate the pics you choose. through the touch bar you can easily access favorite websites in safari or answer (or reject) incoming facetime calls. as you're writing something, you can also get predictive suggestions of the words you may want to type next, similar to a feature found on ios devices. what's more, apple opened up touch bar to outside app developers. so you might employ touch bar when choosing brushes or blending colors in adobe photoshop, one of the partners apple trotted on stage in introducing the feature. there will be touch bar support for microsoft word, excel, powerpoint and other office apps. you can still summon touch bar versions of the physical function keys that used to reside above the keyboard to raise the brightness or lower volume, and the keys are customizable. con: price, usb adapter as with prior macbook pros, they're expensive. macbook pros with touch bar start at $1,799 for a 13-inch model, $2,399 for a 15-inch model. if you can live without the touch bar, you can purchase a 13-inch macbook pro that still has physical function keys for $1,499. apple has added the touch id sensor to the macbook pro, which means you can unlock the mac with a fingerprint, just like you can do on state-of-the-art iphones. it is integrated with the power button. and if you share the mac with other members of your household or office, you can use touch id to take advantage of the feature apple calls ""fast user switching."" when an authorized person places his or her finger on touch id, their user environment takes over. touch id makes it simpler to pay for web transactions through apple pay, which arrived with the macos sierra upgrade and that used to require an iphone or apple watch. longtime fans of macbook pros will appreciate these long-in-the-tooth computers will be outfitted with state-of-the-art specs: sixth-generation dual or quad-core intel core i5 or i7 processors for starters. apple says they'll will run much faster than the prior generation. the entry point is 256gb of storage. moreover, at 3 pounds and 14.9mm or 4 pounds and 15.mm, respectively for 13- and 15-inch models, these are also the lightest and thinnest macbook pros. they are even thinner than the macbook air. the 13-inch model without the touch bar comes with a pair of thunderbolt (usb-c) ports; the 13- and 15-inch models with touch bar four such ports. you can use these to charge the computer -- apple touts about 10 hours of battery life -- or to drive external monitors. but you'll need an adapter to connect your older usb gear or even to charge an iphone, which relies on a lightning type connector you won't find on any macs. alas, none are included in the box, and apple sells a lightning to usb-c cable for $25. the machines have significantly larger force touch trackpads than the prior generation, and apple says the butterfly-mechanism keyboard (based on the keyboard first introduced on the macbook) has been improved",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"Touch Bar could be super useful, but we'll have to see",10/28/16

""as it was, andy (lincoln) and norman (reedus) and the rest of the cast accepted me immediately. now, i feel like this is my family."" morgan embraced negan's dark side, which includes humiliating and breaking rick (lincoln) in retaliation for the killing of saviors. he expected some  fan hostility. ""i'm not going to make excuses for him,"" says morgan. ""but in this world, the people that have survived this long since the zombie apocalypse all have done things that are bad. negan just happens to take a little bit of glee (in) exercising justice, but this is a man who also leads a group of people and keeps them alive. rick's group has killed (more than 20) of his men, and so far negan has only touched two of them."" morgan has the charismatic presence and acting skill to make negan a complex villain, says executive producer greg nicotero, who directed the bloody premiere. ""jeffrey brings the smile and charm of a guy who is genuinely engaging, and then he immediately switches it to that menace. he can go from a little sarcastic and slightly wisecracking to a guy who is 100% in charge,"" he says, calling it ""a coiled cobra intensity. the scene where he grabs rick's face, you just see how powerful he is. ... six seasons in, we've never seen fear on rick's face, never seen rick broken. this guy has been able to do something no one has been able to do."" in coming episodes, viewers will see negan's home, the sanctuary, where he has numerous wives, and will learn more about his nature.

""cloth diapers make it easier to transition to toilet training because the child can feel when they are wet,"" stranger says. the cost of diapers vs. disposables comes down to the type you buy, how many your baby uses daily and how long it takes to potty train. either way, shop around to get the best deal. making food vs. buying some parents like the convenience of more costly on-the-go food to supplement their more affordable home cooking. others -- such as thelma luisa anderson, who works 40-plus hours a week as a hairstylist in teaneck, n.j. -- don't have the luxury of extra time. even though her son rey alexander is almost 2, anderson still sometimes gives him baby food in a jar.

" the third big japanese automaker, nissan, has largely sat it out. it offered an altima hybrid sedan in 2011, pathfinder hybrid suv in 2014 and murano hybrid suv in the past year but hasn't shown a lot of commitment to the technology. nissan now is fighting back. along comes the hybrid version of the 2017 nissan rogue, a nice compact crossover suv hybrid designed to give toyota's rav4 hybrid a run for the money. just how much money is yet to be seen. nissan hasn't disclosed rogue hybrid's prices. the conventional rogue starts at $23,820, plus $940 in delivery charges. rogue's hybrid version clearly will be more, but it will have to be competitive with rav4 hybrid, which was listed at $28,370, plus $900 in shipping, when we tested it earlier this year. there, the hybrid option was only a $700 premium over the conventional version. another sign that nissan is committed: it estimates hybrid sales will make up a respectable 10% of the sales mix on rogue, spokesman dan passe says. ""this is a very serious effort,"" he says. nissan hybrid is expected to be rated at 33 miles per gallon in city driving, 35 mpg on the highway and 34 combined in the front-wheel drive version. that compares with 26 mpg city, 33 mpg highway and 29 combined for the conventional version. yet the 2-liter 4-cylinder engine backed up by an electric motor puts out an adequate, though not overwhelming, amount of power -- 141 horsepower that, when combined with the electric motor, amounts to 176 horsepower overall. rogue can stay in electric-only mode at speeds up to 75 miles per hour. and perhaps the best thing about it, you're never really cognizant it's a hybrid. the switches between the gas engine and batteries are smooth. besides a likely higher price, the tradeoff for being a hybrid is the hybrid battery in the cargo compartment. it extends about an inch or two above the normal cargo area. here's what we liked about it: it has a classy, bright, upscale interior, one of the best in class. there are handy pockets in the backs of the front seats and heating controls for the rear seats. the around-view camera makes the rogue hybrid easier to park in tight spaces than other suvs. rogue hybrid has an impressive array of safety gear, including lane-departure warnings and forward emergency braking. our favorite feature is decidedly low tech: it has a warning beep when backing in electric mode. the real question becomes whether the rogue hybrid is better than the rav4 hybrid. that's tough. rav4 hybrid has plenty of oomph and its own impressive gas mileage -- 194 horsepower and 32 mpg combined in its all-wheel-drive version -- and both are solid, nicely crafted vehicles. what stands out hybrid: nissan looks serious this time. size: the two-row compact is a handy size, yet carries plenty. interior: upscale. 2017 nissan rogue hybrid what? a two-row compact suv. where? made in smyrna, tenn. when? comes in december. how big? 15.4 feet long. what makes it go? a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor, coupled with a continuously variable transmission. how thirsty? 25 miles per gallon in the city, 32 mpg on the highway and 28 mpg overall",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"Nissan puts Toyota RAV4 on notice with Rogue Hybrid SUV; Both prove to be solid, nicely crafted vehicles",10/28/16

""the data shows that this post-retirement spending increase happens across all income groups,"" said sudipto banerjee, a research associate with the employee benefit research institute. maybe it's because people feel that after working all those years, they deserve to splurge and take that big trip or join friends for a round of golf more frequently. but it's also possible people are sitting at home looking at an ugly kitchen thinking, 'hey, i should do something about this.'"" contact susan tompor at stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,Practice saying this: 'I'm living on a fixed income',10/28/16
" enamored with the 1945 cape cod in bayside, n.y., she threw herself -- and her savings -- into renovating it. but soon after redden had spent considerable money on improvements, her business-coaching firm lost a top client. with retirement looming, redden, 63, needed another source of income. today, she's breathing easier with a reverse line of credit that allows her to pull money from her house as she needs it. being able to stay in the home she loves while tapping its equity for a financial cushion was a win-win, redden says. ""the key to deciding if a reverse mortgage is right for you is finding the right company to work with,"" says redden, who did extensive research before contacting american advisors group based in orange, calif. ""my loan officer took the time to listen to my financial goals, and there was no pressure or sales pitch."" redden is one of 58,000 people who took out a home-equity conversion mortgage in 2015, according to the national reverse mortgage lenders association. an hecm is a federally insured reverse mortgage through the federal housing administration. if you're nearing retirement or already there, and you're worried you won't have enough money, a reverse mortgage might be a smart strategy. how they work reverse mortgages let homeowners 62 and older access their home's equity without paying a monthly mortgage  or taxes on the proceeds, says chad nicholson, a mortgage broker with american financing in aurora, colo. the fha's requirements to apply for a reverse mortgage include that you must be at least 62, that your home is your primary property and you live in it full time, and that you have no delinquent federal debts. a reverse mortgage isn't free money; you have to repay the loan when you sell the home or when you or your spouse no longer live in it, nicholson notes. however, your surviving heirs still receive any equity beyond the owed loan amount when they sell the home. the amount of money you receive is based on a sliding scale of life expectancy; the older you are, the more you can pull out. all of these reasons make a reverse mortgage a safer option than a home equity line of credit or a personal loan, both of which typically come with higher interest rates and stiff penalties if you miss a payment, nicholson says. ""in retirement, it's all about having cash flow flexibility and living a simpler way of life,"" nicholson says. what it costs one of the drawbacks of a reverse mortgage is the financing costs. borrowers can expect to pay up to 6% of their home's appraised value in fees, including a mortgage insurance premium, third-party fees for closing costs, a loan origination fee and a loan servicing fee. typically, you can roll most of these fees into your loan. also, there is a mandatory $125 financial counseling fee required by the fha. when to use one two-thirds of baby boomers who were employed in the private sector have no retirement income aside from social security, while having less than $25,000 in savings and investments. ""retirees are affected by a lot more risk, and they're more vulnerable to market volatility,"" says wade pfau, professor at the american college of financial services. ""that's where a reverse mortgage is a useful retirement income tool if you plan to stay in your home long enough to recoup the (loan) costs."" if you're a big spender, taking out a reverse mortgage could add to the problem. be responsible with how and when you use the loan proceeds, or a reverse mortgage could cause more problems than it solves, pfau says. deborah kearns is a staff writer at usatoday content partner nerdwallet, a personal finance website",MONEY; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,"Is a reverse mortgage right for you?; For retirees worried about running out of money, it might be smart",10/28/16
" the scheme, which employed a network of telephone call centers based in india, relied on personal information obtained from data brokers to target at least 15,000 victims with threats of fines, deportation or imprisonment if they did not pay the demanded fees. in the thousands of cases where victims did agree to settle the fictitious accounts, the money allegedly was laundered through groups of u.s. co-conspirators using wire transfers and debit cards. twenty of the 24 u.s. suspects were arrested thursday, officials said. one other is in immigration custody, arrests are pending against two more and a fourth, jerry norris, 46, of oakland, calif., is being sought by federal authorities. thirty-two suspects were believed to be living in india, and the court documents also outlined charges against five call center operations. u.s. officials said that they would seek to prosecute the indian suspects in the united states and that the indian government was notified after the charges were unsealed. ""this is a transnational problem and demonstrates that modern criminals target americans both from inside our borders and from abroad,"" assistant attorney general leslie caldwell said of the alleged activity uncovered during a three-year investigation. the co-conspirators, according to federal authorities, used ""hawala transfers"" in which money is transferred internationally outside of the formal banking system to direct extorted funds to accounts belonging to u.s.-based individuals. according to the indictment, the conspirators allegedly kept a percentage of the proceeds for themselves for taking part in the transfer. in the case of a san diego victim, prosecutors allege that a call center extorted $12,300 from an 85-year-old woman after threatening her with arrest if she did not settle phony tax violations. the same day that the payment was made, a u.s.-based suspect allegedly loaded a debit card to buy money orders in frisco, texas. another california victim lost $136,000 to suspects posing as irs agents demanding payment for fictitious tax charges. the suspects, according to court documents, contacted the victim multiple times during a period of 20 days. the money was then allegedly transferred to multiple debit cards. in some cases, prosecutors allege, the conspirators requested ""good-faith deposits"" from victims in exchange for the promise of phony grants and loans. ""to potential victims, our message today is simple,"" said peter edge, an executive associate director with immigration and customs enforcement. ""u.s. government agencies do not make these types of calls. and if you receive one, contact law enforcement ... before you make a payment."" the indian call centers were described in court documents as akin to high-octane boiler-room enterprises, which maintained daily attendance sheets for workers and distributed ""lead lists"" identifying potential targets for callers. some call center operators were literally invested in their work, maintaining ""equity shares"" in their businesses. all five of the call centers charged in the case were located in ahmedabad, gujarat, india, according to court documents. ""during the course of the conspiracy, the call center conglomerates often acted together to effect the scheme to include: sharing call scripts and lists of potential victims, processing payments for each other and liquidating victim scammed funds,"" prosecutors asserted. ""the defendants have perpetrated an enormous and complex fraud scheme that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in victim losses derived from persons located throughout the united states,"" the court documents stated. ""the design of the scheme and the rapid movement of victim funds often resulted in victims being unable to report the fraud in time for their funds to be recovered."" in addition to the estimated 15,000 people who lost money, the identities of up to 50,000 others were stolen to allegedly facilitate the movement of  funds. although the volume of suspected scam calls around the u.s. dropped after the india raids, additional victims continued to be identified, he said, warning that the threat is not over",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"Feds charge 56 in fraud scheme; $300M allegedly taken from 15,000 victims using call center workers in India posing as federal agents",10/28/16

" the fbi, it seems, has been investigating whether anthony weiner, the  former congressman and estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin, exchanged sexually explicit messages with a minor. state department emails turned up on at least one of weiner's electronic devices. so comey authorized ""appropriate investigative steps"" to review whether any of these emails are relevant to the inquiry into whether clinton mishandled classified information. nothing has emerged to contradict comey's original conclusion, reasonable in our view, that clinton's private server arrangement was extremely careless but not criminal. but the last thing the clinton campaign wanted, less than two weeks before the election, was a spate of news stories containing the words email, fbi investigation, sexting and anthony weiner. what should voters make of all this? for one thing, comey's note was unnecessarily vague. it did not say whether fbi personnel have analyzed the latest batch of emails, and whether they are new or duplicates. it raised far more questions than it answered. despite this lack of clarity, republican nominee donald trump, showing his normal penchant for hyperbole and disregard for due process, would have people believe that the email controversy is ""bigger than watergate"" and provides further evidence that clinton should be locked up. never mind that comey acknowledged that the fbi ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" or that watergate was the worst political scandal in u.s. history. or that under the constitution, you don't get locked up until you've been charged with a crime and convicted. or that trump is now praising the same fbi director he had been denouncing as corrupt. whether voters should think more poorly of clinton is impossible to say. that's why comey -- having disregarded justice department guidelines about commenting on active investigations, particularly ones so close to election day -- has an obligation to accelerate the inquiry and provide voters with a more detailed update before nov. 8. over the weekend, clinton and her supporters attacked comey's decision to disclose the latest twist in the email inquiry. clinton called the move ""deeply troubling,"" and campaign chairman john podesta termed comey's letter ""long on innuendo and short on facts."" that's one way to look at it. another is that comey, who has exercised unusual transparency in this  case and who made an ill-advised promise to keep congress abreast of new developments, was caught between bad choices. imagine the uproar had he kept mum and word of the weiner-related inquiry leaked out even closer to election day. if clinton wins, she'll be able to point to the fbi director's letter as further refutation of trump's bogus assertion that the election is rigged against him",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,FBI email letter raises more questions than it answers,10/31/16

""i was kind of a bernie (sanders) supporter, but that's not happening anymore, so i've got to suck it up,"" says anastasia van ryck degroot, 21, a student from hoboken, n.j., who was among those surveyed. in a follow-up phone interview, she says she has gotten more enthusiastic about backing clinton after watching the presidential debates, and she has ruled out the alternative.

""it's not good that it comes down to voting for a third party,"" she frets, ""only because people say third party is kind of pointless and all that."" trump continues to show historic weakness among younger voters, backed by 21%. and he doesn't have the advantage of being able to deploy surrogates with sway. the endorsement of former new york mayor rudy giuliani, one of trump's most outspoken supporters, was rated as ""very important"" by just 10% of younger americans. that influence was dwarfed by the power of parents (""very important"" for 31%) and friends (26%). what's more, despite declarations at campaign rallies appealing for support from african americans, trump is backed by only 6% of black millennials who are likely to vote, another historic low. he is supported by 19% of latinos. the poll of 1,299 young adults, taken oct. 24-27 by ipsos public affairs, included an over-sample of racial minorities and hispanics to provide statistically significant data for a breakdown of presidential support. the online poll has a credibility interval, akin to a margin of error, of +/-3.5 percentage points for the full sample and +/-5.5 points for the subsample of 668 likely voters. among millennials likely to vote, clinton leads trump among whites by more than 2-1, 57%-27%. but her yawning millennial margin comes from her 14-1 support among african americans (84%-6%); 4-1 support among asian americans (67%-15%) and 3-1 support among latinos (66%-19%). her lopsided support among minority and hispanic millennials mirrors her strength among those demographic groups in the electorate generally. but white millennials are much more likely to support her than their elders. in the latest usa today/suffolk university poll, released last week, clinton trailed trump among white likely voters overall 41% to 45%. there's another way millennial voting patterns differ from the electorate at large. among all voters, clinton has built a solid lead among women while the divide among men is close. but in this survey, as in the four previous polls in the usa today/rock the vote series this year, men younger than 35 are much more likely to support clinton than their female counterparts: 56% of younger men compared with 43% of younger women.

""in fact, it is not just strange: it is unprecedented and deeply troubling."" podesta told reporters: ""just to recap and put this in perspective, there's no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, no indication that this is even about hillary."" the republican team sees the fbi news as a potential turning point in a race that seemed to be slipping away from trump just a few days ago. a series of polls last week gave clinton solid leads over trump, both nationally and in battleground states he needs to win in order to amass the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. polls over the weekend -- including ones with questions asked before the fbi announcement -- showed a tighter race, including in such pivotal states as north carolina and florida. texas-based political consultant matt mackowiak said continued news stories about clinton will benefit trump and republican congressional candidates. mackowiak said clinton probably remains the favorite -- she ""has a better path to 270 electoral votes"" -- but ""there is much greater uncertainty and volatility today than there was friday morning."" democrats, meanwhile, sought to rally their voters in light of the new developments. the campaign for america's future/institute for america's future, which describes itself as ""the strategy center for the progressive movement,"" told backers in a fundraising e-mail sunday that trump ""has closed the gap with hillary clinton,"" and the ""trend goes one place, and it's not good."" urging supporters to get themselves and others to the polls, the e-mail said that ""this election will be won on the ground."" patrick murray, director of the monmouth university polling institute, said early polling since friday reflects ""a slight dent"" in clinton's lead nationally, but it's not clear if it will shift results in states that generate electoral votes. a loss of clinton votes could help republicans in congressional races and other down-ballot contests, murray said",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"FBI gives Trump election lifeline; Weekend polls show tighter race in pivotal states like Fla., N.C.",10/31/16

" (hint: the dodgers aren't in the series). yet at least one economist doesn't rule out the possibility. while fears of roiling markets and thus possibly swaying the election are playing some role, the fed has other reasons to stand pat, including mixed economic data. employers added a tepid 156,000 jobs in september. and although the government reported friday that economic growth accelerated to a 2.9% annual pace in the third quarter, gains in consumer spending and business investment were modest. what's more, the fed is  seen as unlikely to bump up rates at a meeting that's not followed by a scheduled press conference in which chair janet yellen can explain the move. goldman sachs also notes the fed has been loath to make a move markets aren't expecting on fears it could spark a sell-off. fed fund futures reckon there's just a 9.3% chance the fed will act this week. more likely, goldman says, is fed officials will strongly signal a december hike. fueling some speculation that the fed could hike at a two-day meeting that begins tuesday was the split decision at its september gathering to leave rates unchanged. three policymakers dissented, and 10 forecast at least one rate increase by year-end. the fed has kept its benchmark rate at a historically low 0.4% since lifting it in december for the first time in nine years. ""should a rate hike lead to market volatility, there is the possibility it could have some marginal impact on the election outcome,"" says barclays economist rob martin. he adds that with americans voting just six days after the fed meeting, there would be little time for stocks to settle. and, he says, since there's no difference to the economy if the fed acts in november or december, why not wait a bit? the fed boosts rates to temper inflation, but price increases have been meager. fed officials likely would prefer not to swing the election either way. but practically, a market sell-off could dim perceptions of the economy and president obama, and by extension, democratic candidate hillary clinton. also, with some businesses saying election-related uncertainty is damping their confidence and investments, economists have suggested it would be prudent for the fed to hold off and assess the vote's impact on markets. yet even doing nothing can draw fire. in september, republican nominee donald trump accused fed chair janet yellen of keeping rates low to help obama. yellen told reporters that ""partisan politics plays no role in our decisions."" in recent weeks, though, some fed officials have grudgingly acknowledged the face-off is part of the picture. ""what i'm worried about is depending on the outcome of the election and what happens after that, if there are policies that would have distortive effects that we would have to respond to,"" philadelphia fed president patrick harker told reporters this month, according to bloomberg news. asked about the election's impact, boston fed president eric rosengren, who wanted to lift rates last month, told the wall street journal the market's view that december is far more likely ""is a reasonable bet",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Fed could surprise complacent investors; A rate hike this week is still a possibility, but it's a long shot",10/31/16
" a frequent problem with business theory is that it's created by people -- business people whose priority is not consistently being logical but consistently making money -- who are not very good at theory. the other problem is that business theory is often not a theory at all, but hype. it's a lot of people -- buyers, sellers, bankers and other hopeful windfall participants -- trying to persuade each other to do the thing that will enrich them most, even if it's at the other's cost. at&t ceo randall stephenson and time warner ceo jeffrey bewkes have been, in recent days, often pictured together, as though they are allies and true believers in a cause. in fact, bewkes has long been of the view that what stephenson wants the world and his shareholders to believe -- it should own the content it distributes -- is utter hogwash. much of bewkes' ceo career has been about dismantling that idea and offloading time warner's considerable distribution network. but, at $109 a share, bewkes is a sudden convert to the theory he has long rejected. even the key part of this thesis, that at&t is in the information business, is not really true. rather, what's true, is that it is no longer entirely in the highly regulated telephone industry and is now, faced with massive competition and rapid transformation in the communications business, existentially trying to redefine what business it uniquely is in. ""information"" is the valuable part of the communications business, so that's a good place to start when you are redefining yourself. but, in fact, at&t has never informed anyone of anything. it has never been in the business of parsing or evaluating or seeking or shaping information, which is the value in information. at&t has never been paid to write even one sentence. delivering information and creating information are not just different skills, they may be inimical ones. the former must relentlessly seek efficiencies, the latter must tolerate many hopeless inefficiencies. the job of a media company is to create products that its audience wants and that it will pay for, even when the audience often has little idea what it wants or is willing to pay for. in other words, it's a widely speculative enterprise. because this involves a vast array of unique products -- each product, relatively speaking,  must be original -- the job resists standardization. indeed, it's a job that involves taste, emotion, sexual attraction, cultural nuance, visual surprise and quite a bit of walking the fine line between offensiveness and wit. and it's a job that, contrary to  traditional corporate behavior, has to indulge big egos -- at every level. some of the most important people in at&t's corporate culture will suddenly be writers. in this new theory of how at&t morphs from infrastructure giant into information giant -- indeed into a pop culture enterprise -- engineers will have to lie down with comics. of course, theories, or anyway business theories, can put the complicated parts aside. indeed, part of the business theory that the $85.4billion deal for time warner rests on is that bigness and vastness are in themselves a business solution. if you are the biggest, everybody has to basically do things your way, including other distributors of your content, consumers and even washington, which might otherwise say you are too big, except that you are big enough to have enough lobbyists to argue the opposite. pay no attention to the fact that, as mercilessly described in banker jonathan knee's classic book the curse of the mogul, bigness theory has consistently failed to make money for media company shareholders. but the other part of business theory, maybe the most important part, is that it is short term. nobody is looking for a generational solution. one might not even be looking for a solution at all, but rather a diversion. that is, when you don't know what to do, you still have to do something, and that could be pretending you know what to do, while you continue to try to figure out what to do",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Business theory behind AT&T's $85B mega merger is twisted; Being the biggest has consistently failed media shareholders,10/31/16
" it's a frigid early april sunday morning, and six blocks of madison avenue have been cordoned off for the last day of filming doctor strange (in theaters friday), marvel studios' latest superhero flick that introduces british star benedict cumberbatch as the title neurosurgeon-turned-wizard. cars are parked at the red light, city folks stroll by, but things are not what they seem. doctor strange and fellow spellcaster karl mordo (chiwetel ejiofor) are being chased through the streets by the villainous kaecilius (mads mikkelsen) and his evil zealots, who've just torn apart the good guys' sanctum sanctorum in greenwich village. but no passers-by notice this magical battle because the primary players are in what's called the mirror universe. ""they can't alter the real world,"" mordo explains to strange in regard to their pursuers. ""but they can kill us."" it's a crazy landscape that stephen strange learns about and audiences will behold. while the avengers hold down the job of protecting their earth from the more conventional menaces of the marvel cinematic universe -- invading aliens, killer robots, etc. -- strange and his fellow masters of the mystic arts such as mordo and their guru, the ancient one (tilda swinton), take on threats coming from various parts of the larger multiverse. ""what's exciting about this movie in the mcu is what was exciting about doctor strange in the 1960s: it introduced other dimensions that no other comics had done,"" says director scott derrickson. ""the ambition of those comics had an impact on all the marvel characters of the future and what they were able to do."" doctor strange shows audiences a different sort of movie magic through visually stunning sequences -- in the aforementioned scene, kaecilius is able to bend reality around them, so strange and mordo are forced to run on the sides of buildings and jump between skyscrapers to escape certain doom. yet this big-screen tale, the 14th in marvel's continually growing tapestry, is also strange's redemptive origin story. he goes from an arrogant doctor whose hands and spirit are broken after a car accident to a desperate man who puts his trust in the supernaturally powered hands of an enigmatic bald woman (swinton's ancient one) in the secret nepalese city of kamar-taj. ""this is a superhero movie about 'it's not about you,'"" swinton explains. ""it's actually saying that the most powerful thing that you can do with your life is live beyond ego and fear."" when cumberbatch, known for his work on tv's sherlock and being one of the internet's most beloved actors, is on the streets of new york, the paparazzi are never far away. strange's crimson cloak of levitation and warm eastern-style boots (""i could almost get away with wearing these in parts of east london"") keep him cozy in chilly temperatures, and just being in town for a movie production is kind of a dream come true. during filming, kids would come up to him and say, ""you're playing doctor strange! no way, that's cool!"" and cumberbatch would be amazed they were familiar with the comic at all. ""i mean, i can get (their) parents' generation or maybe grandparents would know it."" created by artist steve ditko, doctor strange burst out of the pages of marvel's strange tales in 1963 and since then has become known for having trippy adventures in extraordinary new worlds drenched in inspired weirdness. ""he doesn't have super strength or invulnerability. you can still poke him with a knife or shoot him with a gun,"" says screenwriter jon spaihts (prometheus), who penned the script with derrickson and c. robert cargill. ""despite all his magical gifts, he was frequently overmatched and playing a desperate game of 'stay alive,' fighting enemies far vaster than he. that drama, and the psychedelic backdrops it often played out on, riveted me as a kid. it still does."" back in the mcu's earliest days after launching iron man in 2008, marvel knew it had a strong character but wasn't ready to debut him yet, says executive producer stephen broussard. still, the studio would often get calls from both actors and directors wondering when a doctor strange movie was happening. ""that helped tell us there was an inherent interest."" when the quirky guardians of the galaxy hit huge two years ago, marvel realized there was definite interest from the mainstream to explore uncharted corners of the comic-book realm. the filmmaker behind horror films such as sinister and deliver us from evil, derrickson wanted to push beyond the visual-effects innovations of the matrix and inception to build new possibilities as he added his ""genuine metaphysical passion"" to the marvel landscape. he found himself influenced by salvador dali, geometries and structures of german expressionism, contemporary surrealist photography and, most important, the old comics. ""that ditko art is still progressive and it hasn't been ripped off for other movies because other movies couldn't do it,"" says derrickson. the director wanted strange's ""magical mystery tour"" -- a sequence where the ancient one flings the fledgling hero through the deadly dark dimension as well as an odd place where he's enveloped by countless tiny hands and other crazy locales in the multiverse -- to be as visceral for the audience as it is for the magic man. ""you've got to feel like you're with him as somebody who's desperate and skeptical and has a justifiably fixed point of view, and here comes this expansive experience that's just so outside of anything he ever thought was part of the real world,"" derrickson says. ""that's what makes him finally humble himself and learn something for a change."" cumberbatch's spirit was never broken, though, as he powered through a lot of stunt-wire work and fight scenes. one battle finds doctor strange in his ghostly astral form facing one of the zealots in the same hospital room where trauma surgeon christine palmer (rachel mcadams), strange's ex, is trying to patch him up. to create strange's multidimensional journey, cumberbatch recalls being hooked up to a gravity rig similar to the one sandra bullock got whipped around in making gravity. ""hat's off to her, jesus. and in a spacesuit as well. i really know what that feels like now."" while cumberbatch and strange don't share similar traits, there was complete parity when it came to physical predicaments. ""i could learn with my character, so that struggle is probably more real than it should be,"" the actor says with a laugh. ""he's fleeing for a lot of the movie or fighting to defend his life. the victories are really sweet because they're all through sheer (chutzpah) and will, which is him."" while there were retro artistic inspirations, doctor strange brings a lot of the character's lore into modern times. one example is wong, a character who's often been portrayed in the comics as strange's manservant and gets upgraded to a mentor of sorts portrayed by british actor benedict wong. ""what we now have is a drill sergeant, a librarian -- and not your everyday librarian. overdue books will cost you broken fingers,"" wong says. ""this is a master who stands alongside strange."" and the ancient one, an old asian man in the comics, was retooled to be a female mystic played by swinton as strange's opposite number. ""i figured if he's going to be all pumped up on pain and agony and bitterness -- he's so connected to the material world and it all crashes and he takes it all so badly and he's all strung out and raw -- she had to be incredibly light and flexible and relaxed and easy and full of breath,"" swinton says. ""she's got this long, long view of hundreds and hundreds, of thousands and thousands of years, and she doesn't sweat the small stuff (or) the medium stuff. i don't think she sweats at all."" the ancient one has had eons to reach her place in the sorcery pantheon but even when the credits roll on doctor strange, cumberbatch feels stephen is still learning: ""with any superhero, it's a couple of movies in before you think, 'yep, he knows what to do with that shield. yep, that hammer is going to do that. that suit is going to fly there.'"" now that he's part of the marvel family, though, cumberbatch is getting invited to the group gatherings. he will have a role to play in avengers: infinity war, which begins filming in atlanta early next year. ""i'm really looking forward to hanging out with the people i'm crowding in with. it's a hell of a crowd,"" says the actor. is cumberbatch gonna freak out a little bit sharing a soundstage that first time with the likes of robert downey jr.'s iron man and chris evans' captain america? for sure. he may be a sorcerer supreme, but he's only human. ""every time i meet someone who i've watched and admired their work, there's always an element of me feeling a bit goofy and silly. and when it comes to superheroes, there will be a moment on set, i'm sure, where i'll catch myself really trying to stop asking for selfies,"" cumberbatch says, laughing.

" it was political malpractice for the obama administration to allow the name obamacare to take hold. it was also ridiculous for democrats in congress to call their bill the patient protection and affordable care act. no matter what it costs, health care is never going to be considered affordable. what we have here is akin to a clash of civilizations: liberals who believe health care is a right and a public good that shouldn't hinge on private insurers trying to remain profitable, and conservatives who believe the free market and canny individual shoppers can drive down costs. from those starting points, the two sides have been trying to either make the law work or do what they can to make sure it doesn't. i bought health insurance twice under this law, so i know it better than most americans. there are a few key points that should not get lost, including that 20 million people have gained insurance under aca; that republicans have not offered plans on a similar scale; and that we can fix much of what's wrong if we all take a few steps toward the middle ground. david: let's dispense with this 20 million number first. the majority of those who gained health insurance coverage were added to medicaid. that's not health care ""reform""; it is spending. the second largest group, as many as 6 million, are young adults now covered under their parents' plan until they turn 26. that is just cynically telling young people they are getting something for free when everyone else with insurance is paying for it. so it is not a surprise that the price of the benchmark obamacare insurance plan is jumping an average of 25% nationwide. for the millions of americans getting their insurance through the obamacare marketplaces, that's a disaster even though the blow will be cushioned by federal subsidies. and it is just an insult that obamacare architect jonathan gruber went on cnn to opine that ""the law is working as designed."" apparently, the law was designed so that one in five obamacare ""beneficiaries"" have exactly one insurance carrier to choose from for 2017. the democrats made promises for health care reform that were widely known to be laughable. to give cut-rate insurance with multiple thousand dollar deductibles to a few million people, democrats have messed with the health care of every american, and 25% annual rate increases are just a taste of what is to come if this foolish scheme isn't abandoned. jill: so many points to argue, so little space. expanding medicaid has given millions access to health insurance and services, many of them children and people with jobs. to me that's wonderful. the same is true of making it possible for children to stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 (and not for free, you have to pay extra). that's a safety net for young adults who can't find jobs, whose jobs don't offer health insurance, or who want to start businesses. it's also a way to broaden the pool to include generally healthier young people. democrats have not ""messed with"" the health care of millions. they are trying to fix what insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, drug companies and everyone else has spent decades messing with. they have not messed with nearly half the country that gets coverage at work, whose family premiums rose about 3% from 2015 to 2016. or the 36% who get coverage through government plans such as medicare and medicaid. only 7% of the country buys insurance through the aca marketplaces. it is hugely complicated and expensive. the first time i bought a policy, i had to ask a friend with a ph.d. in health economics to sort out my options. i didn't qualify for subsidies, and under aca insurers are allowed to charge me three times more than a younger person. my choices were constricted -- because congress vetoed a government-run public option health plan and an option to buy in to medicare, and because i live in washington, d.c., a small market that attracted few companies. and yet, before the aca, insurers could charge whatever they wanted based on age, gender or health status. they could also restrict, cancel or deny coverage due to medical conditions that may be found in up to two-thirds of the country. i can assure you i would never have been able to get insurance -- and the peace of mind that comes with knowing you can go to your doctor and weather a medical crisis without bankrupting your family -- except for the aca. it needs to be fixed, and there are ways to fix it. but first we have to agree that we need this law. david: i feel your pain. i have gone without insurance when i was between jobs. i have paid out of pocket for prescriptions. if ever there was an industry that deserved the regulatory hammer, the health care industry is it. i just had my fourth kid but only recently wrapped up the last nagging bill dispute over kid 3. the problems don't come from a free market gone wild. they come from 75 years of increasing government interference that has made health care costs opaque to americans with insurance. as health care costs became invisible, pressure to keep prices down disappeared and health care inflation got out of control. more government rules, like the 1,000-page obamacare legislation, won't fix that. and obamacare doesn't simply regulate the 7% of americans who get their insurance through government marketplaces. it is reshaping health insurance for all of us. and while you are right that family premiums for employer-based insurance went up slowly last year, the costs that employees are paying for health care went up faster. when government regulation squeezes one place, inflation just pops out in another. the examples abound. obamacare is pushing insurers to narrower networks of health care providers, which puts people in a new bind: consumers can keep their doctors or risk a disruption in their care when they change plans. for those with serious health problems, that can be huge. if republicans came up with a scheme to foist this choice on the sick or push poor people into subpar medicaid plans, democrats would be outraged. but as democrats make all americans' health care more and more like medicaid, we're supposed to celebrate and ask for more. president obama has already signed 14 laws passed by the republican congress intended to fix aspects of obamacare. there is no magic cure to our health care problems, so anyone who is promising that a new round of tighter rules will fix things is selling snake oil. david mastio, a libertarian conservative, is the deputy editor of usa today's

""this is a pretty good time -- given the consolidation in the industry and other activities that are afoot for us -- to really change the frame for how we want to think about loyalty and how we want the guest to think about that,"" says hyatt hotels president and ceo mark hoplamazian. in addition to competition from the likes of airbnb and homeaway, major hotel brands are also trying to persuade  travelers to book rooms directly with them vs. online travel agencies such as travelocity and expedia. choice, marriott, hyatt, hilton worldwide, and other chains have all this year started offering discounts to guests who book directly through their channels vs. the online travel agencies, as long as they become loyalty program members. but there are plenty of other perks that they are offering. it's a shift in thinking after years in which frequent guests were frustrated by the process of earning and redeeming points. the hyatt gold passport program will be rebranded into the world of hyatt. the three new tiers will be called discoverist, explorist and globalist. guests will advance to the tiers based on qualifying nights or base points within a year. right now, there are just two tiers determined by nights and stays. it takes more nights to get to the first elite tier in the current program. ""it will provide very compelling benefits at every level of the program,"" hoplamazian says. ""there are more ways to experience hyatt and get benefits from that than there were in the existing program."" base points can be earned for spending on dining and spa treatments. guests will also earn a free night once they've stayed at five different hyatt brands. hyatt has 12 brands and 667 properties as well as the unbound collection of independent properties. elite members will also get confirmed suite upgrades at the time of booking. wyndham rewards is taking a different approach to attracting new customers. it has acknowledged that people don't always want to stay at hotels. the company has for a long time had a vacation rental arm. already, wyndham made some major changes to its rewards program by letting guests redeem any hotel stay for 15,000 points across the board, low for the industry",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"Hotel chains overhauling loyalty programs; Hope to woo travelers away from Airbnb, Travelocity, others",10/31/16
"s., canada and mexico in 1994. but even as the pros and cons of the north american free trade agreement continue to be debated in the u.s. election campaigns, new opportunities for commerce among the three countries are emerging, including opportunities in energy. among the biggest openings involves imports of clean electricity from canada, where hydropower provides the bulk of the nation's power supply, with plenty to spare. electricity harnessed from dams and reservoirs in quebec, manitoba, ontario and british columbia accounted for 63% of canada's electricity supply in 2015, with nuclear energy following at 13%, and wind energy way behind but growing at 2%. all told, 83% of canada's electric generation is emission-free, compared to 32% for power supplies in the u.s. and 25% for those in mexico, according to sergio marchi, the president and ceo of the canadian electricity association. ""we are keen to share that resource wealth with our friends to the south,"" marchi said at a forum on cross-border electricity tradein washington. as the head of a trade group that represents the electricity business in canada, marchi obviously has a vested interest in promoting sales in the u.s. nevertheless, the timing seems right to look increasingly to our neighbor for more green power. for starters, the u.s. and canada, not to mention mexico, are all committed to reducing their carbon emissions under the global climate accord struck in paris last year. that could change, of course, if trump is elected and he follows through on his pledge to reverse president obama's climate commitments. at a north american leaders' summit in ottawa in june, obama joined canadian prime minister justin trudeau and mexican president enrique peí±a nieto in announcing a goal of 50% clean power generation for the three countries by 2025. among their proposals for achieving that goal is approving new cross-border transmission projects involving renewable energy. the obama administration's clean power plan, which seeks to curb electric-utility carbon emissions by 32% by 2030, provides added incentives for some states to look north of the border for electricity options, although the policy is being challenged in court by 27 states. ""it's become abundantly clear that clean energy is the future,"" marchi said. canada and the u.s. have been electricity trading partners for more than 100 years. but in 2015, canadian net exports to the u.s. set a record of nearly 60 terawatt hours, worth $2.8 billion canadian ($2.1 billion u.s.), thanks to a drought-induced decline in u.s. pacific northwest hydropower, comparatively low prices for canadian electricity and other factors, data from the national energy board in ottawa show. that electricity trade relies on 35 or so transmission lines, and more capacity will be needed to expand the cross-border flow. ""one of the biggest hurdles will be maximizing the value of existing transmission capacity and building new capacity necessary to accommodate the growing power flows that we speak of,"" marchi said. six such projects are under development to bring canadian electricity to new england, new york and other regions of the u.s. but some face  opposition from residents and business owners who object to new lines being strung across their regions or who prefer other energy options. if all six projects are approved and built, canada will be able to increase its electricity exports to the u.s. by 50%, marchi said. despite some resistance in the u.s., marchi is hopeful that electricity trade between the two countries will grow now that government leaders are setting new clean energy national goals, and that the trend will continue under the next u.s",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"Opportunities abound for electricity trade; U.S., Canada and Mexico see that clean energy is the future",10/31/16
" the october jobs survey highlights a flood of economic news that also includes reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and service-sector activity. consumers took a break in august after splurging in previous months, leaving consumption flat. but retail sales picked up sharply last month on strong vehicle purchases. and brisk activity at restaurants and bars likely offset sluggish demand for utilities, says nomura economist lewis alexander. economists estimate the commerce department will report monday that consumer spending grew a healthy 0.4% in september. on tuesday, the institute for supply management releases its index of manufacturing activity. factories have struggled since 2014 as a strong dollar made u.s. shipments pricey for overseas buyers and the oil downturn hammered drilling-related investment. with oil prices partly rebounding and the dollar leveling off, manufacturers have stabilized. in september, factory activity bounced back with a modest pickup after a slight contraction the previous month. economists reckon ism will record similar growth for october. the fed meets wednesday, but with the election just six days later, no one's expecting a rate hike. a divided fed voted to hold its key rate steady last month and indicated it intends to lift it by year's end for the first time in 2016. yet a surprise rate increase this week could drive down stocks, affecting americans' view of the economy and of the  candidates. plus, with the 5% unemployment rate and rising wages, fed chair janet yellen said the ""economy has a little more room to run,"" and she doesn't want to put up a roadblock just yet. look for signals in the fed's post-meeting statement that a rate hike is coming in december. the service sector has been humming. ism's activity index posted the fastest pace of growth in nearly a year last month. economists expect ism on thursday to announce just a modest pullback in october's expansion. owing to the vibrant service sector, job growth has been solid this year. last month, employers added 156,000 jobs. layoffs by manufacturers and oil companies are partly to blame. but the 5% unemployment rate also has left fewer available workers, making it harder for employers to find job candidates. economists estimate the labor department will report friday the economy added 165,000 jobs in october, while the unemployment rate fell to 4",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,Friday's jobs report will be key to Fed's rate-hike plans,10/31/16
" using a designation called ""ethnic affinities,"" facebook lets advertisers target and exclude facebook users. pro publica placed a housing-related ad that excluded african americans, asian americans and hispanics. facebook says it bans advertisers from using ""ethnic affinities"" to discriminate against racial or ethnic groups. the multicultural targeting is designed to make advertising more relevant and inclusive to diverse communities, christian martinez, head of multicultural at facebook, said in a blog post. ""our ad policies strictly prohibit this kind of advertising, and it's against the law,"" martinez wrote. ""if we learn of advertising on our platform that involves this kind of discrimination, we will take aggressive enforcement action. we also realize that, as a website, we often aren't in a position to know the details of an apartment rental or job application -- and so we will also remove an ad from our platform if the government agency responsible for enforcing discrimination laws tells us that the ad reflects illegal discrimination."" facebook generates nearly all of its revenue from advertising. key to its success: letting advertisers target very specific audiences by tapping into the extraordinary amount of data facebook collects on its 1.71 billion users which it supplements with information purchased from data brokers. facebook says its users cannot identify their race or ethnicity on facebook. affinity targeting is based on interests they have declared or facebook pages they have liked. ads targeted to the majority make him feel marginalized, martinez said. ""advertising should empower you to learn about things that are relevant to you, that speak to you, that reflect you and your community. it's also empowering to see content that validates your community as one worth reaching,"" martinez wrote. multicultural targeting of ads can help marketers reach demographics most interested in certain products or services, said joseph turow, a professor who researches internet marketing at the university of pennsylvania's annenberg school for communication. ""but it's really tough to find bad actors, especially when you are allowing millions of people to buy their own ads on facebook,"" turow said. facebook says it's is not alone in the industry in offering multicultural micro-targeting to advertisers. rigel oliveri, a professor of law at the university of missouri who researches fair housing and online advertising, says the practice raises ""serious legal problems"" when it comes to housing. ""there's a part of the fair housing act that makes it illegal to have discriminatory advertising. that part applies to both the person taking out the ad and also the publisher of that ad,""  she said. university of connecticut law professor jon bauer says if facebook allows housing ads to be targeted in a way that excludes racial and ethnic groups, ""they are clearly violating the fair housing act of 1968."" the same would hold true for other areas covered by civil rights legislation such as employment, bauer said. according to the fair housing act of 1968, it's illegal ""to make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin."" pro publica said when it showed facebook's ""ethnic affinity"" option to civil rights lawyer john relman, he said: ""this is horrifying. this is massively illegal",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,Report: Facebook allows advertisers to micro-target,10/31/16

" though the actual difference in wait times was small, on average 90 seconds, it is another reminder that the online economy  mirrors a flawed world. ""technology was supposed to be a tool that mitigated discrimination because it's based on algorithms rather than subjective expectations. ""but we see that doesn't always happen,"" said darrick hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy at the new school in new york city. researchers at the university of washington, stanford university and mit used black and white university students to study the behavior of drivers for uberx and lyft. all told, they took nearly 1,500 rides on controlled routes. the tests were conducted in seattle and boston. in seattle, african-american riders using uberx waited approximately 30% longer to be picked up than white riders. black riders waited on average 5:15 minutes while white riders waited 4 minutes. the researchers suggested drivers may have taken longer to identify black riders at pickup, adding to the wait time. uber drivers do not see riders' photos, only their names. there were no statistically significant differences in waiting times for lyft users. in boston, the study compared riders of multiple races who could plausibly have been either black or white. they were given two accounts on each service, one with an african-american-sounding name and one with a white-sounding name. when they tried to hail rides with a black-sounding name, the ride cancellation rate was double that of those using white-sounding names, 10.1% vs. 4.9%. ""going from almost never having a ride canceled to having one in six of your trips canceled is going from 'very convenient' to 'this is a pain in the butt,'"" said don mackenzie, an author of the paper and professor of transportation engineering at the university of washington. despite the differences, black seattleites or bostonians using african-american-sounding names didn't have a perceptible increase in average wait times, probably because the network of drivers in both cities is so dense there were always other drivers available, the researchers said. uber and lyft emphasized that they do not tolerate discrimination and their belief that ride-sharing apps make transportation more equitable and available than taxis. that was borne out when researchers had students hail cabs in downtown seattle. the first available taxi stopped 60% of the time for a white student but less than 20% of the time for black students. the white students never had more than four taxis pass them before one stopped. african-american students saw six or seven cabs pass them in 20% of cases",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Blacks forced to wait longer than whites for UberX rides; Cancellation rate for African-American names was double,10/31/16

" wall street is hoping that turning the page from october to november will jump-start a market that has been stalled since hitting a record high in august. november kicks off what historically has been the best six months for stocks. since 1950, the dow jones industrial average has posted average gains of 7.4% in the november-through-april period, compared to a 0.4% return may-through-october, the stock trader's almanac says. the dow has made little progress since first topping 18,000 in december 2014, but optimism is growing that november could be the start of something good.

""what if you could save nearly four hours round-trip between sí£o paulo's city center and the suburbs in campinas? or imagine reducing your 90-plus-minute stop-and-go commute from gurgaon to your office in central new delhi to a mere six minutes,"" they wrote. plus with more people in the air, the company anticipates it loosening the burden on the roads, particularly in heavily congested areas. the company acknowledges that there are challenges for getting this project off the ground. as opposed to using helicopters, which are expensive and noisy, the company will instead be relying on vtols, or ""a network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically."" the vtols are cheaper and quieter, and their electronic basis also means they will be better for the environment than the gas-powered helicopters. battery technology still needs to improve, and as these are flying vehicles, the company notes, there will need to be some air-traffic control mechanism in place. these vehicles also will need properly trained pilots at the controls, at least until they too become self-driving. plus there's the economics. this type of flying aircraft, which is already being developed by a variety of companies including joby aviation, zee.aero and airbus, will be pricey initially, though uber anticipates that with scale it will drop. for the consumer, it sees prices starting out high but dropping over time due to its uber pool system. a 45-mile pool vtol, for example, would replace a 60-mile car ride for potentially as low as $21. and the trek would be only 15 minutes",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,Uber trying to elevate its ride game with flying cars,10/31/16

" store cards charge an average interest rate of 23.84%, compared with the 15.18% national average for all other credit cards, creditcards.com found. some store cards charge even more, such as big lots (29.99%), zales (29.24%) and staples (28.24%). to put that in perspective, if a consumer put $2,000 on an average store card and paid $100 a month, they'd pay an extra $574.37 in interest over 26 months -- compared with $321.53 over 24 months for an average, general-purpose card, said matt schulz, senior industry analyst for creditcards.com. what's more, the bonuses retailers use to entice people often are lackluster. the creditcards.com survey found that half of the 100 biggest stores offer sign-up bonuses, but only 13 offered more than $25 for a $200 purchase. ""for the most part, these cards can't match up with what general-purpose credit cards offer,"" schulz said.

""i don't recommend month-to-month use out of any of these cards,"" sullivan said. ""never carry them in your billfold."" schulz cautioned buyers to resist pressure at the checkout counter to sign up for cards they don't really want. instead, take a brochure, read the details and apply the next time you return to the store, if you still want it. sullivan recommended a close eye on store cards' interest rates and any  fees. annual fees should be deal breakers for people eager for a one-off deal or a chance to rebuild their credit, he said",MONEY; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,29.99% interest?

" but she didn't anticipate a $1,000 invoice for something called ""loss of use."" no one ever does. ""loss of use"" is a car rental concept that, on the surface, seems reasonable. if you damage a car and it has to get repaired, you compensate the company for what it would have made as a rental if the vehicle had been available. but under the hood, loss of use looks more like a junk fee. a few weeks ago, when i wrote about the latest push to sell car rental insurance, many of you told me i'd omitted an important detail. some car rental coverage,  doesn't cover loss of use. thomason, a research associate from reading, mass., said her  insurance company told her not to worry about her supposed loss of use. ""they said that after lots of back and forth, the fees usually disappear,"" she recalls. except when they don't. loss of use has been upheld by some courts, notably in a 2012 colorado case in which the state's supreme court ruled car rental companies could collect damages even if they didn't suffer any financial losses. but customers and consumer advocates believe loss of use is on shaky ground. andrew stoltmann, a chicago attorney, says loss of use is ""problematic."" ""there are limits to what companies can put in a contract, and all contract terms must be reasonable,"" he says. also, car rental companies are lightly regulated, and loss of use is one of the areas where there's virtually no consumer protection. although loss of use is a legitimate legal claim in some states, the claims are generally difficult to prove, according to wayne cohen, a professor at george washington university law school. the problem? they can fall apart quickly when car rental customers, or more frequently insurance companies, challenge the value of the claim. car rental companies calculate their loss of use according to a formula that often uses a theoretical rate. but to customers, it just looks made up. but what's the right thing to do? if you dent up a car and your insurance doesn't cover loss of use, should you have to foot the bill? the request seems fair. a car no longer can be rented, so the business suffers as a result. while loss of use might be allowed in some states, it sets a problematic precedent. every time you pay it, you are effectively agreeing that a business has the right to charge you for what it might make if circumstances had been different. because car rental companies' expensive loss-damage waivers and collision-damage waivers cover this  loss of use charge, some readers chided me for not recommending car rental coverage. yet i still can't. many insurance companies refuse to pay loss of use, and when it comes right down to it, the losses suffered by a car rental company should be thought of as a cost of doing business in the auto rental industry. that's the interesting thing about loss of use. too often,  companies won't bother to justify the lost use or to prove the car would have been rented, making it a junk fee in the truest sense. thomason's case had a happy ending. it turns out her insurance company was correct. after months of fighting, her loss of use charges vanished. elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for national geographic traveler. contact him at chris@elliott.org or visit elliott.org. how to fight loss of use ask your insurance company for help. insurance companies take a no-nonsense approach to junk fees, including loss of use. the fight is usually over before you get involved. ask for the documents. car rental companies don't always keep accurate records of the rental, and that's not just true of repairs. ask them to prove the car would have been rented. if  the company refuses to justify the fee by failing to show  the paperwork, a successful credit card dispute may be a slam dunk. threaten to sue. this is one of those rare times when the threat of a lawsuit may offer an escape",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,Customers lose it over car rental 'loss of use' fees,10/31/16

", and watch game four of the world series, good luck. twenty-two minutes into the pre-game show, a donald trump ad promised to lower health care costs. twelve minutes later, a hillary clinton spot showed trump mocking a disabled reporter. and then, deep into the game, another clinton ad likened trump to famous bullies from movies such as back to the future and the karate kid. americans have had it. it might seem funny -- and heaven knows comedians and political cartoonists have had a field day with it -- but election exhaustion is real. it appears to have shown up in everything from psychiatrists' couches to the dow jones industrial average. a pew research center survey found that about six-in-ten americans felt exhausted by the amount of election coverage -- and that was way back in early summer, before donald trump's ""access hollywood"" tape and anthony weiner's sexting further complicated things. the singer sheryl crow started a change.org petition to shorten the election cycle. ""by the time americans go to the polls on november 8th, this presidential campaign will have run over 600 days, kicking off with ted cruz's announcement in march of 2015,"" the petition says. more than 55,000 people have signed on, and stars bette midler and courteney cox have tweeted their support. there are even web browser extensions that will block election news. one is called, simply, remove all politics from facebook. and there's i haven't got time for the 'paign. another, called social fixer, can be used to filter out many things on social media, and developer matt kruse says the political filter is the most popular among his 300,000 users right now. ""i expect political fatigue to last for quite some time,"" he says. ""one of the key features is that i update the filters in the background, so as new political terms come up in the news, users don't have to do anything to continue having them filtered."" the ugliness of the campaign certainly gets part of the blame for ramping up anxiety and fatigue -- an american psychological association survey says more than half of adults say the election is a significant source of stress -- but the very length of it has also turned people off. it's like christmas decorations going up at walmart in mid-july. and it seems endless, always tripping ahead: nearly half of likely florida voters say sen. marco rubio's re-election campaign is more about setting up another presidential bid in 2020 than serving the state, according to a bloomberg poll. even 28% who support him say that. one downward-cycle result: while more people just throw up their hands, only the most committed are still yelling, and yelling ever more loudly to reach those who are turned off, thus turning off more people who really just want to watch two long-time losers playing joyfully in the world series. ""people who are highly partisan are more likely to be interested in politics and they're less likely to be tired of it,"" says tom hollihan, political communications professor at the university of southern california. ""people who are not so politically engaged, i'm sure they're exhausted by the conversation, and they're not actively seeking information at this point."" it doesn't have to be this way. a chart comparing the length of u.s. elections to others makes ours look like a triathlon compared to light workouts. many people are exhausted from trying, for so long, to be on their best behavior to avoid inadvertently inciting political arguments, says rockville, md.-based psychologist mary alvord. ""there is a lot of tiptoeing around,"" she says. and we are tiptoeing at home, work, kids' soccer games, social events and more. ""the story has permeated every aspect of our life,"" says vaile wright, a clinical psychologist and director of research and special projects at the american psychological association.

" republican presidential nominee donald trump has made bashing china and mexico a staple of his campaign. both he and democratic nominee hillary clinton have turned sour on the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), the proposed pact linking 12 nations in asia (excluding china) and the americas. and recent numbers show that trade volume has flattened out globally after years of expansion. but there is good reason to believe that the harsh anti-trade rhetoric is more a function of politics than public sentiment. a pew research center poll in august, for instance, found that 50% of respondents view free-trade agreements as a positive, while 42% see them as negative. that level of support is essentially where it was early in the year and down slightly from mid-2015. the same poll found that tpp was supported by 40% and opposed by 35%, with the rest unfamiliar with the deal or not having an opinion. there is also good reason to see that the economic case for trade is strong. yes, trade creates winners and losers. and, yes, more needs to be done to retrain displaced workers and offer them educational opportunities. but the winning side is wider and deeper: trade produces cheaper consumer products for struggling families. in most contexts, americans would not support policies that make them pay more for something just to benefit a relative few. they certainly wouldn't tolerate tariffs on imported oil to prop up domestic energy producers. so why should they be made to pay more for cars or clothes or building supplies? trade produces competition that spawns innovation. who could doubt that detroit creates vastly better products now than it did in the 1970s, when imports were a relatively insignificant part of the domestic auto market? trade produces export-related jobs. many of the job losses blamed on commerce agreements are actually the result of technology that allows more goods to be manufactured with fewer workers. while it is true that trade and automation have been brutal on certain types of jobs, trade has had a brighter side as well. the united states exports $2.3 trillion in goods and services each year, producing 11.3 million jobs. these export-related jobs tend to be higher skilled and better paying than the ones eliminated. many of them are in high tech, pharmaceuticals and financial services. and, in fact, access to world markets has allowed companies such as apple and microsoft to become iconic global brands. exports have also come from some surprising areas. in 2014, for instance, honda became the first japanese car maker to become a net exporter from the united states. the remorselessly protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail, including trump's over-the-top attacks on nafta and clinton's flip-flop on tpp, appeals to voters in rust belt battleground states",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Memo to candidates: Stop bashing trade,11/1/16

""we think there's no better value than free,"" said jeremy verba, vudu's vice president and general manager. for free, i got to watch true grit -- not the 1969 john wayne version but the 2010 film starring jeff bridges as rooster cogburn -- after viewing a trio of 30-second commercials on my tablet. three more popped up about one-third of the way through. to many, that would be a small price to pay to check out a movie or tv episode. more than half of walmart customers are willing to watch ads for free or discounted movies and tv, verba says. when walmart acquired vudu in 2010, the santa clara, calif.-based streaming service focused on the rental and sale of high-definition movies on demand. since then, vudu has added a disc-to-digital service in which you pay $2-$5 to convert a dvd or blu-ray disc into a digital movie. you can also easily add digital copies of purchased disney movies and discs that support the ultraviolet online storage format to your vudu account. and walmart's instawatch feature automatically adds digital copies of dvds and blu-rays bought in walmart stores or on walmart.com to your vudu library. digital movies sold in walmart before the physical disc versions come to retail can be added automatically, too, by scanning a qr code. once in your vudu account, movies and episodes can be viewed on mobile devices (android and ios), computers and smart tvs. you can use vudu via apps on smart tvs, net tv devices such as google chromecast and roku, video game systems such as playstation 4 and xbox one and blu-ray disc players. vudu plans to add new releases to its movies on us selections regularly. the free service could serve as a gateway to vudu's higher-end options, too. beyond hd, many vudu movies come in the hd enhanced hdx format and -- even better -- 4k ultra hd, which has more than four times the resolution of standard hd. some 4k movies sport high dynamic range (hdr) with improved contrast, detail and color. and a growing number of films come with multidimensional dolby atmos surround sound. (for more information on compatible tvs and products go to vudu.com.) several million consumers already buy, rent and watch content on vudu, verba says: ""we want to grow that, and we think advertisers will be very attracted as well to reaching these customers in the living room in an on-demand environment.""

" thirteen stocks in the standard & poor's 500, including networking provider akamai technologies (akam), netflix (nflx) and the gap (gps), posted 10% or greater gains just in the month of october, according to a usa today analysis of data from s&p global market intelligence. these strong performances stood in stark contrast to the 1.9% decline set by the s&p 500 itself. investors go into october with an understandable amount of fear. october is known as the jinx month because many of the most infamous crashes have occurred during the month, including in 1929 (down 20.4%),1987 (down 23.2%) and 2008 (down 14.1%), says stock trader's almanac. stocks did lose some momentum again this october as jitters over the election and the rising probability of an increase in short-term interest rates intensified. investors in october continued to shift their bets toward are aggressive growth stocks, and away from more ""safe"" dividend plays, as they look to profit even if the fed boosts short-term interest rates, says michael farr, president of farr, miller & washington. ""the large majority of investors now believe that the fed will go ahead and raise the fed funds rate for a second time at its december meeting,"" he says. ""this is being interpreted as a vote of confidence in the economy.  as such, the desperate quest for yield has become less important."" nonetheless, there were breakout winners largely due to big surprises during earnings season. akamai was the october champion. the company, which helps speed up internet traffic, gained 31%. investors were pleased when the company reported an adjusted quarterly profit of 68 cents a share, which topped expectations by 11%, says s&p global. the bottom line rose 10% from the same period a year ago, which is the kind of growth investors are having trouble finding. earnings for the s&p 500 are only expected to rise about 3% in the third quarter. but when it comes to october earnings surprises, it's hard to top netflix. the video streamer saw its shares soar 27% during the month due to quarterly earnings that blew away estimates. netflix reported an adjusted quarterly profit of 12 cents a share, which was double what wall street expected. the company earned 71% more in the just completed third quarter than in the same period a year ago. it wasn't just tech, though, that sidestepped october's pain. the gap wound up powering 24% higher during october. the retailer, struggling to find its niche in a world where fashion players such as forever 21 and h&m have sprouted up, is still seeing profits fall. the gap reported an adjusted profit of 60 cents in the july quarter, which was down 6% from year-ago levels. but the bottom line was almost 2% better than expected. investors seem to be looking at other ways to profit, though. the gap's price-to-earnings ratio of 15 is below the more than 20 times valuation of the s&p 500. it also has a dividend yield of 3.4%, which easily tops the market's roughly 2% yield. a good month of october doesn't mean investors are in the clear. analysts are calling for gap's earnings to drop 21% in 2017. and despite akamai's solid third-quarter results, michael bowen, analyst at pacific crest, worries about future growth from the media industry where the company assists in the streaming of movies, tv, live events and software downloads.

" perhaps most damaging so far was the criticism leveled by nearly 100 former justice department officials who characterized the director's decision to notify congress of a new review of emails that could be related to the previously closed hillary clinton inquiry as nothing short of ""astonishing"" so close to a presidential election. ""we cannot recall a prior instance where a senior justice department official -- republican or democrat -- has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election's outcome,'' the former officials, including former attorney general eric holder, wrote. the scathing public evaluation of comey's decision, which also defied long-standing justice department policy not to take actions in advance of an election that might appear to interfere with its outcome, threatens to cast a permanent shadow on the remaining seven years of the director's term, some current and former government officials said. rep. elijah cummings, the ranking democrat on the house oversight and government reform committee who has been one of comey's most vocal advocates, expressed deep concerns  that the fbi's institutional integrity hung in the balance. ""i have great personal respect for director comey, and i sincerely believe that he is a man of integrity, independence, and good intentions, but i have grave concerns that the credibility of the fbi could be damaged in immeasurable ways,"" cummings said. the congressman's statement is extraordinary given that this summer he was lauding the director for, in part, comey's defense of his decision not to recommend criminal charges against clinton and others over their handling of classified information. ""i don't know whether your family is watching this,"" cummings told comey during an  appearance before the house panel in july, ""but i hope that they are as proud of you as i am."" yet the gusting political forces inextricably linked to the email inquiry and comey's role in it, some suggest, thrusts him into a potentially untenable position, especially if clinton wins. ""if you are president-elect clinton, how do you put this behind you, particularly if this whole matter is still pending when you take office?"" said ron hosko, a former assistant fbi director and head of the bureau's criminal division who supports comey. ""how can you have an effective relationship if every time you are in the same room together this shadow looms? ""this is a fraught, perilous path that he's on,"" hosko said. ""i think he had to go into this with eyes wide open; i don't think he took this lightly."" aides have said that comey considered counsel from senior executives and the top investigators assigned to the concluded clinton email inquiry before making the decision. the bulk of the newly discovered material, more than 600,000 emails, however, weighed heavily on the director who had told a congressional panel in september that no substantial information had come to light to warrant a new review. the risk of that information leaking, either before or after the election, was viewed to be more potentially damaging to government institutions than to acknowledge its existence last friday. the potentially new emails, linked to top clinton aide huma abedin, were found in early october during a search of a laptop she shared with her estranged husband, former new york congressman anthony weiner. the former lawmaker is the subject of separate fbi inquiry into his sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl. federal investigators have since obtained a warrant to search through the abedin emails to determine if they have any bearing on the previous clinton inquiry. it is unclear whether the review can be completed by election day next tuesday, a process that has reunited many of the investigators who worked on the initial clinton inquiry. while the new review involves a voluminous number of communications, an official familiar with the matter said authorities have not totally foreclosed the possibility that the task can be completed before election day. in letters to congressional leaders monday, the justice department pledged that the review would be completed as ""expeditiously as possible."" but some, including one former top justice department official, said that the management of the clinton email investigation has been fraught since july, when attorney general loretta lynch agreed to accept comey's recommendation on the case's outcome. that decision followed the disclosure of lynch's impromptu meeting with former president bill clinton aboard her justice department aircraft while both were on the tarmac of the phoenix sky harbor international airport. lynch has said the email case was not discussed during the meeting, but the appearance of a possible conflict prompted the decision to cede authority in the case to comey. lynch  later signed off on comey's recommendation after his july announcement in which he also described the former secretary of state's conduct as ""extremely careless."" last week, lynch recommended against comey's notification to congress regarding the newly discovered emails, but the fbi director, an official familiar with the matter said, felt compelled to act to correct previous congressional testimony indicating that no other information in the clinton case was being reviewed",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Email case puts heat on FBI chief; Comey faces scathing political storm for Clinton inquiry so close to election,11/1/16
" as tends to happen these days, our conversation veered into the u.s. presidential elections. ""my friends in london mainly want to know if americans have lost all their senses,"" she told me. she told me this as i thumbed through that week's edition of the economist, whose cover heralded: ""the debasing of american politics."" hacked emails. sexual assault claims. fbi investigations. vows to jail political opponents. corruption allegations. this election season has certainly served up a smorgasbord of reality-tv-like fodder that has stunned and dismayed many of our allies abroad. but we can learn from other nations, too. a good place to start is britain, which is starting to feel hangover pangs from the brexit referendum, in which 52% of voters chose for the u.k. to withdraw from the european union. the pound is down 15% on a trade-weighted basis since the brexit vote, according to the economist, closing in on the depths it reached during the 2008-09 crisis and near the bottom of the 154 currencies tracked by bloomberg. a root cause of the sterling's plunge, according to the british newspaper, is ""fear that britain is turning into a xenophobic, interventionist and unpredictable place, with calls to clamp down on foreign workers and foreign capital."" sound familiar? donald trump's policy agenda up until now has been tinged with similar xenophobic and unpredictable tones, from calling for a temporary ban on muslims entering the u.s. to promises that he'll renegotiate nafta, withdraw from the world trade organization and slap tariffs on mexican and chinese goods. his vows to tinker with and, in some cases, tear up trade deals have some economists most worried. trump has said he will renegotiate many of the deals for better terms. but a recent study by the pro-trade peterson institute for international economics warned that trump's trade proposals, if enacted, could cost the u.s. more than 4 million jobs and spin the country into a recession. as president, trump would have wide leeway to alter trade deals. in a worst-case scenario, if china and mexico retaliate by raising tariffs on american goods, america could be facing a ""full trade war,"" and unemployment could rocket to more than 8%, according to the peterson study. the study's authors examined both candidates' trade policies but concluded trump's would be far worse. ""while clinton's stated trade policy would be harmful, trump's stated trade policy would be horribly destructive,"" one of its authors wrote. so can any parallels be drawn between trump's trade positions and the brexit fallout? plenty, according to jennifer hillman, a georgetown university law professor who focuses on trade and has studied the brexit effect. the rhetoric from supporters of brexit -- fear of foreign workers taking local jobs -- has been nearly identical to those found in trump's rally speeches, she told me. in a speech in north carolina last week, trump reiterated his threat to slap tariffs on goods made overseas by companies that have shipped jobs overseas. ""at the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals,"" he told the crowd. but higher tariffs will not bring jobs back to the usa. more than 85% of them have been lost to automation and technology, not trade agreements, according to most studies, hillman said. ""it doesn't matter what you do with china,"" she said. ""are you going to get rid of every robot at the end of every assembly line? probably not. stopping trade isn't going to bring those jobs back."" britain, through its brexit pains, and other european countries who embrace a nationalist, protectionist philosophy are fast discovering a pesky consequence of that thinking: it's bad for business. ""it's a huge loss for the u.k., and a huge loss for the world,"" hillman said of brexit. of course, trade wars and britain's currency woes are far less sexy than sexual delinquency and hacked emails and will likely get scant air time between now and the nov. 8 elections",NEWS; Pg. 2A,USA TODAY,"Parallels between Brexit fallout, Trump on trade",11/1/16

""we're voting for trump because we judge the leadership of our country"" as failed, thiel said. ""this judgment,"" he added, ""has certainly been hard to accept for silicon valley, where many people have learned to keep quiet if they dissent from the coastal bubble."" some in the tech world have called for thiel to be dropped from the boards of the social network giant facebook and california incubator y combinator over the donations. thiel, who made his fortune co-founding paypal, said the pushback has not affected his business dealings in ""any meaningful way."" but thiel, who also spoke in support of trump at july's republican national convention, said he was surprised by the level of outrage. he specifically called out a leading lgbt magazine, the advocate, for running an op-ed that questioned whether thiel, a prominent gay conservative, could still be considered gay for backing trump. ""the lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear,"" thiel said monday. ""if you don't conform, then you don't count as diverse, no matter what your personal background."" he said trump gets the ""big things"" right, such as understanding that free trade ""has not worked out well for all of america"" and that voters have grown tired of 15 years of overseas conflicts. during his appearance in washington, thiel also defended another controversial position: his decision to financially back wrestler hulk hogan's successful lawsuit against the media site gawker for publishing a tape of hogan having sex. the lawsuit drove gawker into bankruptcy. thiel said the lawsuit was not an attack on the first amendment but that it sought to fight back against the most ""egregious invasion of privacy imaginable."" he slammed gawker as acting like a ""sociopathic bully."" even as he defended trump, thiel made clear that his views diverged from the real-estate magnate's in other ways. when asked about a temporary ban on muslims entering the u.s. once proposed by trump, thiel said he opposes ""religious tests."" thiel is well-known for his contrarian positions, and his activity in the 2016 election is not his first foray into politics. in the 2012 election, thiel gave $2.6 million to a super pac that backed then-representative ron paul's candidacy for the republican presidential nomination. early in the 2016 cycle, he contributed $2million to back former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina's unsuccessful bid for the gop nomination, federal election commission records shows.

" the crazy quilt of 2017 changes is creating angst among both supporters of the law and consumers under 65 who don't get their insurance at work. and it comes as enrollment needs a big boost, especially of younger, healthier people to help offset insurers' costs of covering the sicker people who have signed up so far. ""the way people are experiencing obamacare varies tremendously across the country,"" says larry levitt, a senior vice president of the non-partisan kaiser family foundation. ""in some states, the market is stable and in other places, it's a bit of a mess."" for example, the second lowest cost silver plan -- which federal subsidies are based upon -- was up 116% in arizona and down 3% in indiana. in indiana, four insurers left the exchange and four remain, while consumers in all but one arizona county only have one insurer to buy from. much of southwest florida, which has uninsured rates above the national average, will have a single insurer from which they can select plans: florida blue. nearly 93,000 residents of the gulf coast counties enrolled in exchange plans during the last enrollment period, according to government figures. about 80,000 of them live in counties with a single provider for 2017. ""this year, the vast majority of consumers will qualify for tax credits that help keep coverage affordable, and it's easier than ever to shop around and compare options,"" said health and human services secretary sylvia m. burwell said in a statement. a key point of pride among obamacare supporters is that about 20 million more people were insured early this year than in 2010 before the law took effect. federal data out monday also show, however, that there was no statistically significant difference between the number insured in the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year. decisions by insurers including aetna, unitedhealthcare and blue cross blue shield to leave many states prompted insurance regulators to allow insurers to refile their rate requests, often more than once. that led eight states to approve rates that were often far higher than those originally proposed by insurers. it's critical to attract more people into the exchanges to make them ""attractive for more insurers,"" says ashish jha, a physician who is a professor of both health policy and medicine at harvard. ""we have to fix it one way or another,"" says jha. andy nebel, who has a chicago-area video production firm, was used to the downsides of health insurance as he had pre-existing health conditions before the aca. one plan had a $7,500 deductible per claim. but now he's worried insurance companies are taking advantage of people like him with individual insurance. he's shopping for a new plan because his aetna plan was eliminated. however, the closest hospital for his only blue cross blue shield option is nearly two hours away. ""i understand that poor people who get some federal relief will be able to get affordable health insurance, but middle class individuals who want to buy health insurance are being shut out,"" nebel says. ""what kind of a country is it where i can't leave and start my own company and and get good health insurance?"" the law shouldn't allow health plans to ""dump sick people on other health plans,"" says economist john goodman, a critic of obamacare who helped draft an alternative pending in the senate. but that's what the narrow networks of hospitals and doctors allow by making their plans ""unattractive to people who would have very high health care costs."" young healthy people shouldn't have to bear the burden either, goodman says. the aca forces young people to pay more than many believe they should. ""the federal government created this problem,"" goodman says. ""taxpayers should generally be called upon to solve it, not just a small number of young people in the individual market. "" the centers for medicare and medicaid services will match people whose insurers are leaving the exchanges to another plan, but consumers will only be officially enrolled if and when they pay their first month's premium. most people enrolled in a plan who don't return to the marketplace by dec. 15 -- the deadline for coverage that takes effect on jan. 1 -- will be re-enrolled in their current plan. the tax credits more than 80% of people get to pay premiums will generally keep up with the rate increases, shielding people below 400% of the federal poverty limit -- about $97,000 a year for a family of four -- from most of the pain. but the 30% of people who aren't eligible for tax credits will be especially hard hit. in indiana, four insuers opted not to offer plans for 2017, leaving only four insurers on the exchange. kati averitt and her family are among those bracing for open enrollment until last year, averitt, a teacher, and her husband, who works for a small business, had insurance through her employer. then their infant son arrived and averitt decided to quit her job to stay home. the zionsville, ind., family found a plan they liked for just under $900 a month. then she learned united healthcare was dropping off the exchange.

" she stepped up to a stage on an island in the east river named for one of her political heroes. that was june 2015, when donald trump and hillary clinton launched their presidential campaigns in earnest three days and 1 mile apart. at the time, the proximity didn't seem important; the candidacies didn't seem equivalent. she was an inevitability, already the assumed standard-bearer for democrats heading into the 2016 campaign. he was an impossibility -- just one more entry, the 12th, in a still-growing republican field. he was expected to contribute little more than reality tv-style entertainment. when his gop rivals talked about trump, they smiled. but now, with election day a week off, it's clear that first week contained clues about why neither campaign would go as expected; why clinton's juggernaut would be slowed by bernie sanders, yet ultimately prevail; why trump would rout his competition, including nine past or present governors and five past or present u.s. senators. saturday, june 13, was clinton's first big rally, held on roosevelt island at a park also named for franklin d. roosevelt, who in the war year of 1941 enunciated ""four freedoms'' he said people everywhere deserved: freedom from want and fear, and freedom of speech and worship. clinton promised ""four fights,'' none as readily memorable as fdr's freedoms: to create a fairer economy, to strengthen families, to maintain america's world leadership and to reform government. she did not mention trump, his treatment of women or his taxes. she called herself a ""fighter,'' unaware her eventual opponent would be one of the biggest brawlers in the history of u.s. politics. trump announced the following tuesday at trump tower. he said many undocumented immigrants from mexico were criminals and rapists; promised to force mexico to pay for a giant wall he'd build along the southern border; complained that americans ""don't have victories anymore,'' especially in trade negotiations. he vowed ""to make our country great again.'' he did not mention hillary clinton, her emails or the clinton foundation. after their announcements, the candidates flew to iowa to campaign. in reality, they'd been candidates for months; trump had formed an exploratory committee in march, and clinton formally announced in april, albeit via online video. but it was in mid-june, nearly 17 months before election day, that 2016's beast of a general election began to stir. looking back, there was much that week told us, not about what was too come, but about how the candidates and their campaigns would handle it when it did. he'd stick to a few themes -- simple, memorable, visceral. that first week it was jobs, immigration and trade. the menu would change over the months to include other items -- crime, election fraud, his opponent's dishonesty. the constant was trump's ability to tap into voters' emotions and probe his rivals' weaknesses. he didn't give a lot of details. he said ""believe me'' a lot. and by the end of the month, he'd trail only jeb bush in a poll of new hampshire primary voters. she'd be cautious, deliberate, detailed. the roosevelt island speech contained a litany of liberal to moderate ideals that appealed to almost every democratic constituency. each word seemed focus-group-tested and committee-vetted. later in the week came specifics. in new hampshire, she called for universal prekindergarten for every 4-year-old within a decade. in south carolina, she proposed a $1,500 tax credit for certain businesses that hire apprentices. asked in an iowa radio interview about president obama's plan to send 450 military advisers to iraq to combat the islamic state, she spoke slowly and carefully: ""i do not believe that u.s. troops should be on the ground in iraq doing combat. i think what the president is trying to accomplish is using the unique skills that the american military has in intelligence, surveillance, training, to buttress the efforts of the iraqis themselves. i have supported the president's approach to dealing with this very serious treat.'' trump on the same topic: ""we should go blast the hell out of that oil."" he'd be unscripted. trump had no text, no teleprompter, no filter. he was spontaneous, occasionally rambling, always entertaining. he was immodest -- ""i'm really rich,'' he said -- and shamelessly plugged his hotels and golf courses. ""i like going off script,'' he said after his announcement. but he seemed to have it in his head. he'd live (or die) with social media, free tv and a bare-bones organization. trump, the organizational genius who said he ""built a great, great business,'' didn't have much of a political organization. he didn't seem to think he needed one. not with 3 million twitter followers and 1.7 million facebook fans at the time. in the 24 hours after he announced, 3.4 million facebook users shared information about trump 6.4 million times. when bush announced that monday, the comparables were 493,000 users and 849,000 messages. she'd bend, but not break. clinton's flexibility was on view that week on trade -- one of the few issues that united trump and sanders, but that she handled bloodlessly in her kickoff speech: global trade had ""created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but ... also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of americans.'' she recovered the next day, signaling she was easing away from her original support for the increasingly unpopular trans-pacific partnership trade pact and urging obama to confer with house minority leader nancy pelosi (a tpp opponent) ""to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible, and if we don't get it, there should be no deal.'' by october, she'd withdrawn her support for the agreement entirely. he'd attack, attack, attack. just ask neil young. after the rock star objected to trump's use of his song rockin' in the free world at the trump tower announcement -- young supported sanders -- trump took to twitter to call young a ""total hypocrite"" who once visited trump's office requesting money for an audio deal. trump also had words for bush's open-collared presidential announcement: ""he can't even put on a tie and jacket. he's running for president. maybe he knows something i don't know. maybe i should take it off because i want to be one of everybody. you know what? you run for president, maybe put on a tie."" she'd play the gender card. in 2008, clinton sometimes seemed to downplay her gender. this time she embraced it. on roosevelt island, she joked that while she might not be the youngest person ever elected president, she'd be the youngest woman. trump took note.

" microsoft hosted the grabber. the contrast between the two events was stark. in cupertino, calif., the iphone maker was making a small tweak to the way we work today with the unveiling of a slim interactive function bar to its macbooks. in new york, the onetime software giant was unveiling tools for the way we will work that included a massive interactive drafting table and 3-d design software. anomaly? well, certainly not the norm considering apple's reputation as a headline-grabbing event producer. but evidence is mounting that the software giant, a foil to apple for decades, is now the more compelling, innovative company with forays into virtual reality and artificial intelligence. apple, by contrast, seems more of the cautious, incremental company, building on its mountainous cash pile ($237.6 billion) with refinements to existing products. apple ceo tim cook has talked in interviews about the importance of mixed reality; microsoft ceo satya nadella is wearing the company's vaunted hololens headset around his house. ""microsoft was looking toward future products while apple was updating older products,"" says jack gold, an independent tech analyst. the notion seemed unlikely the past decade, as apple pumped out iphones, ipads, macbooks and apple watch while microsoft sifted through the debris of a crushing $7.2 billion merger with nokia and bounced former ceo steve ballmer, now owner of the nba's los angeles clippers. to briefly recap, microsoft swooped into cosmopolitan new york city to unveil a suite of new hardware and software aimed at taking digital productivity to the next level. the announcements included an ingenious new surface desktop with elaborate hinges that transformed the monitor at the push of a finger into a futuristic drafting table. on the software side, nadella was passionate about how the company would be enabling the creation of 3-d content for a new generation of workers. in contrast, apple's event took place on its relatively modest cupertino campus in a small auditorium whose lobby features two massive photos of steve jobs and one massive quote about the need to do something great at every turn. cook did not have the opportunity to showcase a new category of product but instead introduced a new laptop that features a small screen where the function keys used to be. although it does boast digital touch interactivity, many tech pundits groused that a small strip is nothing compared to microsoft's full-touch screen. while nadella has shown no hesitancy to make bold bets on the future, cook has overseen a series of press events the past two years that were long on iphone upgrades but remarkably short on long-term vision. this was underscored by what his competitors -- google, facebook and microsoft -- shared in public events that touched on their plans in ar, vr, ai, machine learning and car-related technology. the diverging paths are reflected in the recent financial performances of both companies. apple recorded its first year-over-year decline in annual revenue in more than a decade. microsoft has been steadily pivoting to a cloud-first business model that has helped the company become second only to amazon in the global cloud game. microsoft shares recently hit an all-time high of $60 after earnings results blasted by analyst expectations; apple shares, which were nearing a 52-week high, have declined to $113.50 since its product announcement last week. ""microsoft is discovering new energy in its role as a leading software vendor,"" says charles king, a technology analyst at pund-it. ""as microsoft is becoming increasing open and flexible, apple is becoming more rigid. as microsoft is breaking down traditional walls, apple is building its own walls higher."" cook no doubt is a brilliant operations guy who has led apple to unprecedented economic and business success -- a record cash pile, billions of dollars in quarterly profits and a market valuation of more than $600 billion, best in the world. yet apple appears to have narrowed its vision and become far less adventurous in spirit than it was under co-founder jobs. nadella inherited the ceo mantle under far more difficult circumstances and has not only righted microsoft but steered it on an exciting new path",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Microsoft's must-see tech event takes bite out of Apple,11/1/16

(no, she wasn't under sniper fire in bosnia.) sure, like all politicians, she adjusts some positions based on shifting public sentiments. she was for the trans-pacific partnership before she was against it. she was, at the least, ""extremely careless"" with her emails, as comey said in july. her ties to the clinton foundation lead many to wonder whether donors were buying access. her ethics vs. his these would be serious handicaps if clinton were running against jeb bush or john kasich. but she's running against donald trump. to paraphrase p.j. o'rourke, clinton's problems are within the normal parameters; trump's are off the charts. think she has ethics issues? trump faces a civil trial for fraud over trump university. he has denounced illegal immigration while employing illegal immigrants to build his buildings. he claimed to have donated $102 million to charity without giving a penny of his own money. he is a pathological liar who keeps repeating falsehoods -- such as his claim to have opposed the iraq war -- long after they have been debunked. according to politico, he lies an average of once every three minutes and 15 seconds. one of the few times he told the truth was when he bragged about groping women against their will. a dozen women have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault. another  claims in a civil lawsuit that he raped her when she was 13; a status conference is set for dec. 16. this is not ""locker room"" talk. if true, these are criminal acts far more serious than anything in clinton's emails. what land mines await what trump is doing to our democracy is also a serious offense. he vows to lock up his political opponent, calls the election ""rigged"" without evidence, and won't promise to respect the result if he loses. another disqualification: trump is the first presidential candidate in decades not to release his tax returns. we know he probably hasn't paid much if any federal income tax since 1995, when he lost $916 million, contradicting his claims to be a boffo businessman, but we don't know what other ethical land mines are buried in his records. does he have financial as well as sentimental ties to russian president vladimir putin? no way to know. we do know trump is intolerant of dissent. he threatened lawsuits against his accusers and libel suits against newspapers that have reported their allegations. he wants to loosen libel laws to facilitate such suits. he has incited violence at his rallies. he is, in short, a budding authoritarian who should never be given control of the fbi and irs. trump lacks a presidential temperament. he gets flustered in debates. imagine how he'd perform in a crisis. trump is also almost completely ignorant of public policy. he says u.s. and iraqi forces blundered by not launching a surprise attack on mosul, yet can't explain how it's possible to hide 30,000 troops in flat terrain. when trump speaks, he offends. he insulted a gold star family, called u.s. troops thieves, and said sen. john mccain isn't a hero. he mocked a disabled reporter. he said judge gonzalo curiel, who was born in indiana, isn't fit to preside over his fraud trial because he's ""mexican."" he spent years pushing offensive claims that barack obama, the first african-american president, wasn't born in america. he has run the most blatantly racist campaign since george wallace. it's almost an afterthought, but trump does have policy proposals -- and they would be ruinous if implemented: he thinks  nato, the most successful alliance in history, is obsolete. he threatens to pull troops out of south korea and japan, and he doesn't care whether this leads to nuclear proliferation. he wants to order u.s. troops to commit war crimes by killing relatives of terrorists and torturing terrorist suspects. he vows to launch trade wars that will cost millions of jobs. the email flap doesn't change the fact that clinton is sane and safe, while trump is the least qualified, most dangerous presidential candidate in u.s. history. this should not be a close call, america",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,America's Halloween Hangover; Trump scandals make Clinton look good,11/1/16

" the affordable care act, also called obamacare, requires most americans to buy health insurance. this year's open enrollment period lasts from nov. 1 to jan. 31 for anyone buying health insurance on their own. (if you get your health plan through work, your open enrollment time will be decided by your employer.) health plans sold through the marketplaces are sorted into  tiers -- bronze, silver, gold or platinum -- based on how much they will help pay your medical bills, on average. here's how to decide which  tier is right for you. tiers give an estimate of how much a plan will pay each tier  is meant to estimate the percentage of medical costs the plans will cover, based on an average across all buyers of plans within the tier: bronze plans: 60% silver plans: 70% gold plans: 80% platinum plans: 90% health plans within every tier must pay for ""10 essential health benefits,"" which are defined by federal law -- things such as trips to the emergency room, pediatric care, prescription drugs and preventive care such as physicals and immunizations. plans can also pay for treatment beyond these 10 fundamentals, and the overall estimated payments for services determine the tier. the percentage you pay for each tier (such as 40% for a bronze plan) includes your deductible, co-payments and co-insurance. these amounts also will vary by plan, even within the same tier. there is a cap on how much you pay in one year that also varies by health plan; the maximum in 2017 is $7,150 for an individual or $14,300 for a family. this year, ""simple choice"" plans will be available on the exchanges for some consumers. deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance are the same within each metal tier in these plans to make them easier to compare. silver and gold are a good middle ground for many people, silver plans seem to strike a good balance between out-of-pocket costs and premiums. of consumers enrolled in state or federal exchanges as of march 2016, 70% choose a silver plan, according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services. philip lee, a health insurance broker in lafayette, calif., says most of his clients choose silver plans. however, people with more medical needs often upgrade to gold plans because lower costs at the doctor's office or pharmacy offset their higher monthly premiums. bronze and platinum plans might not pay off after silver plans, bronze plans are the next most popular, with 22% of consumers choosing them in 2016 -- perhaps because the premiums are often the lowest available. the trade-off with a bronze plan is higher out-of-pocket costs when you're sick and need to see a doctor or fill a prescription. ""so if you're really healthy and will hardly ever be using the plan at all, ok, maybe bronze is a good choice,"" lee says. on the flip side, lee almost never recommends a platinum plan to clients because the added benefits typically aren't worth the high premiums. only 2% of consumers chose such plans. ""don't get a plan you think you might not be able to afford,"" says adria gross, a patient advocate and author of solved! curing your medical insurance problems. if you can't pay your premiums, the insurer will cancel your plan. there's more to a plan than its metal tier the metal tier is just one of many things to keep in mind when choosing a health plan. ""if any plan doesn't cover your doctors, hospitals and your drugs, it won't work for you,"" gross says. when making your choice, you should: look at the summary of benefits for any plan you're seriously considering. this document tells you what medical services the plan pays for and, perhaps more important, those it does not pay for. make sure you like the plan type. for example, a health maintenance organization, or hmo, will require you to have a primary care doctor and get referrals for any specialists you want to see. a preferred provider organization, or ppo, will give you more leeway in choosing doctors. check the plan's provider network directory to make sure your primary care doctor is listed, if you want to keep that doctor. you can also call your doctor's office and ask whether they accept the specific plan you're considering. check the plan's drug formulary, which is the list of covered drugs, to make sure any prescription medications you take are included. if you don't find this information online, call the insurer's customer service line and ask any questions you have before you buy. lacie glover is a staff writer at nerdwallet, a personal finance website. email: lacie@nerdwallet.com nerdwallet is a usa today content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the web",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,Which health insurance tier is right for you?,11/1/16

""trump really adheres to traditional ... perceptions of masculinity and playing his 'man card' throughout this race. and clinton is a symbol of breaking the glass ceiling."" during this campaign, clinton, 69, has embraced her groundbreaking status in a way she didn't eight years ago, in her first run for the democratic nomination. on the stump, she discusses her delight in being a grandmother. in tv ads, she emphasizes her life-long interest in helping children and families. as president, she promises to address issues such as equal pay and parental leave. for his part, trump, 70, is the first republican presidential nominee to hire a woman as his campaign manager; gop pollster kellyanne conway was tapped after a campaign shake-up in august. he relies on his 35-year-old daughter, ivanka, as a leading surrogate and close adviser. but the thrice-married trump also has mocked fiorina's appearance (""look at that face!"" he said derisively in an interview with rolling stone), denied the implication by rival marco rubio that trump had a small penis (""i guarantee you there's no problem,"" he said at a primary debate) and questioned whether clinton has the ""look"" a president should have. ""she doesn't have the look; she doesn't have the stamina,"" he said at the first presidential debate this fall. ""i just don't believe she has a presidential look, and you need a presidential look."" of course, since the nation's 43 presidents to date all have been men, a woman by definition may not have ""a presidential look."" a backlash against the idea of a woman as president has helped fuel trump's core support among men. in surveys this year by the non-partisan public religion research institute, half of trump supporters said it benefited society for men and women to embrace traditional gender roles; a majority of clinton supporters disagreed. more than two-thirds of trump supporters said ""society as a whole has become too soft and feminine;"" nearly two-thirds of clinton supporters rejected that idea. in an online survey by the research software company qualtrics, released this week, 39% of trump voters said men made better leaders, dwarfing the 5% who said women made better leaders. (among clinton voters, 16% said men made better leaders; 13% said women did.) but the tough-guy persona that has drawn some male voters to trump has driven away some female ones. white, college-educated women supported republican mitt romney by 6 percentage points in the 2012 election; now they back clinton by double digits. that has been crucial to clinton's margin in such battleground states as colorado, pennsylvania and virginia. william frey, a demographer at the brookings institution, says the group could be the ""linchpin"" of a clinton victory next week and an important asset for democrats, if the party can hold their support. the trend was so striking when he analyzed it, frey says, that ""it knocked my socks off."" the release of a 2005 access hollywood video in which trump could be heard boasting about groping and forcibly kissing women was one factor in their flight. allegations of that sort of conduct, while not exactly unheard of in the past, is less likely these days to be dismissed on college campuses or in the workplace as not credible or unimportant. trump's harsh rhetoric about muslims, mexicans and american inclusiveness also has hurt him among women, who increasingly have wide horizons, frey says. ""college-educated women are now in the mainstream in the labor force, in positions of responsibility, and they understand the world is changing."" gender-neutral office? some analysts liken clinton's potential impact in the gender debate to president obama's impact in the past eight years in the nation's debate over race. if she wins, her presidency automatically would expand the automatic definition of who has ""the presidential look,"" for one. among other things, it means millions of american middle-schoolers won't be able to remember a time in their lives when a white man was president. it could open the door a bit wider for the next generation of female officeholders who might be considering presidential bids, such as south carolina gov. nikki haley, a republican, or democratic sens. amy klobuchar of minnesota and kirsten gillibrand of new york. but juliet williams, a professor of gender studies at ucla, cautions against what she calls the ""mythology"" that sexism is a thing of the past, saying the 2016 campaign also has revealed ""the changes we haven't seen"" in attitudes toward women. clinton has been the target of relentless vitriol on twitter. crowds at trump rallies regularly chant ""lock her up!"" and north carolina sen. richard burr apologized this week for joking about putting a bull's-eye over a photo of clinton on the cover of a gun magazine. ""the incredibly disrespectful terms in which opposition to hillary clinton have been voiced (reflect) a fundamental truth, which is that too many people believe they have the right and are entitled to disrespect women,"" williams says, though she said her candidacy was also a ""cause for celebration"" and a sign of progress. ""this is part of the broader culture: there is progress being made even though there are setbacks."" madeleine albright, a groundbreaker of her own as the first woman to serve as secretary of state, says clinton's candidacy has had an impact.

""while the inspector general may have found this relationship was legally acceptable, it certainly begs a closer look at whether ethics rules adequately guard against conflicts of interest than can arise from the personal relationships between contractors and military officials,"" mccaskill, the missouri democrat, said in a statement to usa today. the army has killed the career of another general under similar circumstances. in a case from 2015, the army fired maj. gen. dana pittard after determining that he had merely created the ""perception of preferential treatment"" -- not for personally profiting from his relationship with his contractor friends. last month, usa today reported that bobeck had a decades-long relationship with joe ferreira, a vice president at peduzzi, that blended the personal and professional. before becoming a general, bobeck had negotiated with ferreira to work for peduzzi, for example. both had served in the new york national guard and had held leadership positions in its aviation units. but the emails show that their relationship blurred lines between the professional and personal. in july 2015, when bobeck was serving on the joint staff, ferreira sent him an email thread that included entries from several executives from sikorsky. at the time, allocation of sikorsky black hawks between the guard and active-duty army was a contentious issue. ferreira sent bobeck the email thread from his business account to bobeck's personal email address, calling bobeck's attention to the emails from sikorsky executives. the exchange of information ""highlights how easily a long-term friendship can cross the line and present a possible ethics violation,"" said scott amey, general counsel for the project on government oversight, a non-partisan watchdog group. ""it's one thing to be friends, but it's another situation to be friends and trade information for special access or privileges."" the inspector general may need to review the case, amey said. ""mixing friendship and (pentagon) business could move the needle from the safe zone to the ethical gray area zone, and that deserves a look,"" amey said. the army has had a string of troubling issues with its general officers. last week, the army confirmed that maj. gen. john rossi committed suicide in july; in september, the army yanked the security clearance of maj. gen. david haight after usa today reported  he had carried on an affair for over a decade and had led a ""swinging"" lifestyle; also last month, the army fired a division commander, maj. gen. wayne grigsby, without giving a reason. before being promoted to the joint staff, bobeck held posts with the national guard bureau that gave him responsibility for its aviation units across the country and its overseas territories. the bureau oversees its 453,000 soldiers and airmen. peduzzi, staffed with several former guardsmen, lobbies for sikorsky, whose black hawk gained fame from conflicts from somalia, where it was featured in the book and movie, black hawk down, to iraq and afghanistan. a modified, special operations black hawk crashed during the raid that killed osama bin laden. the inspector general found no issue with bobeck's private relationship with ferreira and peduzzi's business with the national guard bureau, because bobeck ""was not involved in this contract action."" nor was there a conflict with bobeck's work on the joint staff, where his portfolio included weapons of mass destruction, and his friendship with ferriera, the inspector general found. peduzzi wasn't doing business with them, according to the letter to mccaskill, a member of the senate armed services committee. the army quietly removed bobeck from his post on labor day. last month, ferreira told usa today that housing bobeck was simply an act of friendship. he did not respond to a request for comment on this story. bobeck has denied any wrongdoing and asked for privacy. even the perception of a conflict of interest has been enough to end promising military careers. last year, the army fired  pittard, who had been commanding american advisory forces in iraq. he was issued a letter of reprimand ""for improperly creating the perception of preferential treatment."" the punishment stemmed from a contract awarded to pittard's former west point classmates. pittard was not accused of profiting.  a letter of reprimand effectively forces an officer to retire. a board will determine the last rank at which bobeck served satisfactorily",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,General escapes sanction for free housing; Ethical questions remain over gift from defense contractor,11/2/16

"s. troops leave his country would be a major blow to america's new strategy to counter china's growing strength and influence in the asia-pacific region. duterte said in tokyo last week that he wants foreign troops to exit the philippines within two years, even though manila is a longtime u.s. ally. that came on the heels of his visit to china last month and as president obama aims to ""pivot"" u.s. military, economic and diplomatic resources away from the middle east to asia. as many as 600 u.s. troops are currently stationed in the philippines, and at least two major training exercises involving american and other forces are held in the country each year. the bases used by the u.s. military include two airfields located only minutes from the south china sea, where china has built a string of artificial islands in waters claimed by neighboring countries, including the philippines. an international tribunal declared china's claims invalid -- a ruling beijing has rejected -- but the obama administration fears that airfields and other chinese infrastructure on these islands could allow beijing to interfere with freedom of navigation in the south china sea, a vital international waterway. perhaps a sign that duterte is cozying up to china, beijing recently allowed filipino fishermen to resume fishing part of the disputed waters. finding new locations for the u.s. troops and annual war games -- as duterte said he wants -- will not be easy, defense analysts say. ""there's rarely a 'one-for-one' replacement when we lose military resources, such as access to bases in a country. geography and political ties are always unique,"" said grant newsham, senior research fellow at the japan forum for strategic studies in tokyo. he said potential sites for an expanded presence include australia, singapore, vietnam and the northern mariana islands, a u.s. commonwealth in the pacific ocean. duterte, a tough-talking former prosecutor, has alarmed world leaders with a series of insults and seemingly off-the-cuff -- and off-color -- policy pronouncements since taking office in june. he has called obama a ""son of a bitch,"" announced a ""separation"" from the u.s. and said he is prepared to ""revise or abrogate agreements"" with the u.s., an apparent reference to a 2014 base-sharing treaty that allows american forces to be stationed at the five philippine-operated military bases. although aides have walked back some of duterte's more eye-popping statements, defense analysts have nonetheless expressed concern. ""we still don't know what president duterte exactly means about u.s. military presence,"" said tetsuo kotani, senior fellow and maritime security specialist at the japan institute of international affairs in tokyo. this would not be the first time that u.s. forces have been booted from the philippines, which is a former u.s. colony. clark air base and naval base subic bay were shuttered in 1992 after philippine leaders refused to renew long-term leases. the two bases hosted more than 25,000 u.s. troops and dependents, and served as hubs of u.s. military power in the region throughout the cold war and vietnam conflict. meanwhile, u.s. forces continue to train in the philippines, including taking part in two large-scale annual exercises with philippine forces. one of those exercises this year included 8,600 troops from the united states, philippines and australia, along with observers from 11 other countries. plus, a contingent of u.s. a-10 attack planes were previously stationed at clark air base, now operated by the philippines. as part of the diplomatic ""pivot,"" the united states has sought to spread its forces throughout the region, operating from locally run facilities rather than establishing bases of its own. navy littoral combat ships now operate from singapore. about 1,500 marines are based ""rotationally"" in darwin, australia. in november, u.s. and japanese forces will conduct amphibious warfare exercises at tinian island, in the northern mariana islands, a location that has been discussed as a potential permanent joint-training facility. during duterte's three-day visit to japan, he lavished praise on the country, america's closest ally in the region. he also agreed to joint naval patrols. whether duterte will complete his threat to expel u.s. forces from the philippines remains to be seen, said narushige michishita, director of the security and international studies program at the national graduate institute for policy studies, in tokyo. michishita said duterte may be trying to play the region's two superpowers -- china and the united states -- against each other.

" this year's #oscarssowhite campaign targeted the film industry, but midway through the fall tv season, with all 20 new shows now airing, more than a third of the actors on major-network sitcoms and dramas are racially or ethnically diverse, according to usa today research. eighteen series have minority actors in lead roles, up from just six five years ago, with abc and fox leading the way. and more shows are highlighting diverse themes and experiences, not just sprinkling black, latino or asian-american actors into their casts. sure, tv executives are aware it's a hot-button issue, but their motives aren't entirely pure. ""we recognized pretty quickly this was not about social good, this was about good commerce,"" says gary newman, co-chairman of fox television group. ""when you have a country as diverse as ours, you just have to have programming that appeals to different groups."" since empire took off in early 2015, fox has added rosewood, starring morris chestnut as a sexy coroner, and this fall's pitch, lethal weapon and the exorcist, each with black or latino leads. ""people have begun to recognize how much money they can make by targeting underserved audiences,"" says courtney  kemp,  creator and executive producer of power, a  starz series about a black nightclub owner. ""the color that's relevant here is green. it's not about any kind of altruism."" instead, it reflects demographic shifts, and tv executives' need to chase viewers as hollywood faces radical shifts in how and where they find their entertainment. u.s. census data projects the percentage of blacks, hispanics and asians will continue to grow while the percentage of whites declines. and amid steadily declining ratings, blacks are among the most loyal viewers, watching nearly 50% more tv each week than the general population, nielsen says. whatever the cause, public advocacy groups  cheer the result. ""tv has done a really good job of having diverse representation, diverse storylines, whereas the movie studios, especially the big 6, are light years behind,"" says sarah kate ellis, president of glaad. glaad's own study of 2015 found a record 33% of regular characters on broadcast shows were people of color, up from 27% in 2014. some cable and streaming networks have an equal or even better record as more than 400 scripted series dwarf the volume of film releases, creating more opportunities. this fall alone saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed series -- hbo's insecure, fx's atlanta and netflix's luke cage -- all featuring black stars and producers. but progress still lags behind the camera for writers, directors and producers, and at some networks, in front of it. tv has tiptoed into inclusivity at least since the 1960s, when diahann carroll broke barriers playing a professional nurse and widowed mother on nbc's julia, and nichelle nichols co-starred as lt. uhura in star trek. in the 1970s, norman lear tapped into race in good times, the jeffersons and sanford and son, and freddie prinze was co-star of chico and the man. a decade later, nbc's top-rated cosby show presented a mainstream, upper middle-class black family, and later, early seasons of fox, wb and upn had entire nights of black comedies aimed at establishing the startup networks. while reality shows have often embraced diversity, scripted series largely faded from the major networks, which sought more ""mainstream"" series and migrated to niche channels. black, latino and gay characters popped up in ensemble casts as sidekicks and pals in a pattern parodied by south park's token character. ""audiences were so happy (just) to see a diverse face on the screen,"" says darnell hunt, director of ucla's ralph j. bunche center of african-american studies, that complaints were few. five years ago, about the only diverse leads on prime-time network sitcoms and dramas were kerry washington (scandal) and mindy kaling (the mindy project), both in their first seasons. but a new renaissance -- in which ""people of color are at the center, driving the narrative,"" hunt says -- is exemplified by fox's empire, which proved there's a big audience of all types for a drama with an almost all-black cast. now in its third season, empire is the top-rated network series among young-adult viewers, and 63% of its audience is black. abc -- which last year named channing dungey the first african-american programming chief at a major network -- has shows centered on gay, special-needs, african-american and asian-american characters. the outlier is top-rated cbs: all six of its new fall series star white men. ""our goal is always to try to get more diverse,"" programming chief glenn geller said in august. ""we did not meet that goal this year in terms of leads"" -- though the network hastily added several diverse supporting actors to ensemble casts. one business consideration: sales  overseas, a lucrative source of revenue, where shows like empire have struggled. ""people don't like to talk about it, but it's the flip side of what we experience here,"" newman says. ""a lot of those countries are not very diverse, so it's hard for shows like that to break through."" for many actors, the chance to right  wrongs makes motives irrelevant. and they welcome non-stereotypical portrayals in shows like cage, with  diverse characters as do-gooders and not criminals.

""even on so-called diverse shows, you're still going to see a showrunner who's a white man for the most part. ... if you don't have a diverse writers' room, where are those stories going to come from?"" it's not just producers  who influence the shows: the directors guild of america estimates that minorities shepherded  19% of tv episodes during the 2015-16 tv season, up only slightly  from the previous year.  and the hollywood branch of the writers guild of america says minority employment remained flat at 13%. ava duvernay, executive producer of own's queen sugar, and a mostly diverse group of women directed all 13  of the new drama's episodes. duvernay sees incremental advancement. ""it feels like more than in the past, so it's progress, but it's something we need to continue to work on,"" she says. ""when you look at the number of people-of-color-centered shows, the math is not setting the world on fire."" alan yang, an emmy-winning writer-producer (with star aziz ansari) on netflix's master of none, sees the lack of diversity as less  conscious bias than the tendency of top decision-makers, traditionally white men, to assign oversight of tv episodes, which can cost $2 million to $5 million apiece, to people they know and have worked with, who often share a similar background. ""a lot of it is risk aversion,"" yang says.  ""a lot of the business is repeating what's succeeded before."" digital opportunities have provided new, alternative routes for performers, such as youtube-turned-hbo-star issa rae, says actress and producer eva longoria. as a producer, she tries to cultivate talent behind the camera.

""it really shows a disparity of opportunity,"" she says, adding that with experience, sugar's directors have found more work. ""all these women are booking shows."" producers say their own efforts aren't enough: ensuring broader representation has to be part of the culture of networks and studios, from formal training programs to everyday thinking. ""sometimes, it's conscious. sometimes, we force producers to think about it. most of the time it's organic,"" nbc entertainment chairman robert greenblatt says. ""you've got to build the talent pools ... and create the situation where (people are) welcomed into the mix of these shows."" each of the broadcast networks has initiatives designed to increase diversity. nbcuniversal's talent infusion programs (tips) cultivates writers and directors from underrepresented groups, and counts yang and mindy kaling among its alumni. some networks, including fox and starz, fund a minority staff-writing position at each of their shows. veteran  director ken whittingham, who's black, might be the exception who proves the rule. he has become a go-to hire since racking up a string of directing credits on upn  comedies  in the late 1990s, which  opened the door to jobs on gilmore girls, 30 rock, parks and recreation and the mindy project.

" but his overall campaign theme that the entire political system is rigged against average americans is the reason he is still in this race despite his horrible personal behavior and outrageous statements. even though he is a deeply flawed messenger and not up to the job of being president, his message has resonated with millions of americans who will still be angry and seeking change after election day. for years, i and many others have been warning that  u.s. democracy is under threat because our political institutions have become so dysfunctional and our nation so polarized, and because so many millions of independent voters are shut out of the system. this election has revealed it is actually far worse than we believed. trump's political rise did not happen in a vacuum. the seeds of voter discontent that he is exploiting have been sown over several decades of elected officials failing to work together to address the biggest issues facing this nation. that trump managed to win the nomination and get this far is proof of how dissatisfied so many americans are with our political leaders. desperate for change trump is shorting the political system for his own benefit in the same way that hedge fund managers shorted mortgage securities before the 2007-08 housing collapse. they didn't create the crisis that rocked the financial world and damaged millions of people's lives, but they did profit from it. on the day  trump announced his candidacy for president, i wrote that ""his message could resonate not only with angry conservative republicans but also with independent swing voters and others who are fed up and turned off by politics as usual."" desperate for change and sick of a political system that values wealthy campaign donors over average americans, many voters have turned to trump. over the past two decades, these voters have seen their jobs disappear and their financial situations deteriorate, while the extremely wealthy do ever better thanks to government tax and trade policies. in their desperation, they have put their faith in a man who epitomizes everything they hate about the system. not only trump's supporters but also those on the left who voted for sen. bernie sanders believe that the political system is rigged on behalf of the well-connected. a recent politico/morning consult poll found that 41% of registered voters (about the same percentage that might be expected to vote for trump) agree that widespread voter fraud could be used to steal the election for hillary clinton. and 58% said they believe raising questions about the democratic process and accuracy of the 2016 election results is  ""necessary because the election could be compromised by voter fraud or a foreign government."" exploiting a myth this fear of a rigged election has got to be connected with the view of many voters that government no longer works for them and is also rigged. the specter of widespread voter fraud, while illusory, is a myth nurtured by republicans so they could reduce early voting, pass strict voter id laws and shorten polling hours -- making it harder for young and minority voters to cast ballots. it was another partisan ploy, and now trump is exploiting it. but the stakes in this election extend far beyond partisan politics. as president obama declared recently in florida, ""our democracy is on the ballot."" since this nation's creation, the legitimacy of our government has relied  on the consent of the governed -- support for our elections and government institutions by the people. for years, republican officials took advantage of their aggrieved tea party supporters to win elections and insisted the potential for voter fraud was widespread so they could institute harsh voting restrictions and severely gerrymandered legislative districts. what they wound up with was trump as their presidential nominee. now the tiger has gotten out of its cage, and they have no idea how to get it back in. let's hope for the good of this nation that political leaders in both parties have learned a lesson and, like ebenezer scrooge, they have been sufficiently frightened by the specter of trump's ghost of government future to address the systemic issues that made his nomination possible. we can't afford another election like this one. linda killian, executive director of independent americans united, is a senior scholar at the woodrow wilson center",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Right theme But wrong candidate; Trump's flaws may be fatal, yet his message is keeping him in the game",11/2/16

(she's probably going to be president, so we will find out.) trump fans frequently criticize the #nevertrump crowd by accusing them of sucking up to the liberal media. it should be made clear that the reason these conservatives oppose trump is because he is a laughable candidate who could damage the republican party for years. but it's also true that this brief relationship has been enjoyable. it's not very often that conservatives get to say the words, ""yeah, george clooney is totally right,"" or ""i watched a michelle obama speech from beginning to end."" but here we are, and we should  appreciate it while we can. and even if it doesn't last, it was nice that it happened. even if it only happened because we barely favored a terrible presidential candidate over an unconscionable one",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,A bipartisan affair to enjoy while it lasts,11/2/16

""as consumers in general, and with millennials in particular, we're getting used to everything being cheaper, faster, better, and banks aren't keeping up,"" he says, pulling out his smartphone. ""this right here, this is the only branch that matters."" hinrikus says the recent wells fargo scandal, which found employees creating fake customer accounts and took down ceo john stumpf, is part of a post-2008 financial crisis reckoning for large banking institutions. ""it's not like we loved banks before (2008), but the crisis showed us that they're not looking out for us,"" he says. ""they're greedy bastards out for themselves. that's eroded a lot of trust people have in banks."" transferwise has raised $115 million, including a $58 million series c round in 2015 led by silicon valley firm andreessen horowitz. earlier rounds were funded by richard branson and peter thiel, the maverick paypal co-founder who has kicked a hornet's nest recently with his fierce support of republican presidential candidate donald trump. according to a february mckinsey & company survey  about 2,000 financial tech, or fintech, start-ups have sprouted up to try to challenge the hegemony of banking institutions. despite the boom in companies with names such as kantox and smallworldfs, transferwise is among the few with mushrooming scale. now operating in 35 countries, transferwise offers customers a tech-fueled service to transfer money for a fee that ranges from 0.5% to 1% of the transaction. critical to its consumer proposition is the fact that transferwise uses a midmarket exchange rate. banks sometimes provide a money-transfer wire service for free, ""but then make their money on a high fx (exchange) rate,"" hinrikus says, adding that a wiring money with transferwise is roughly ""eight times cheaper than using a bank."" the ceo made a stateside visit last week to announce that transferwise, which opened its consumer-oriented business in the u.s. a year ago, would begin offering a new business-payments service. hinrikus estimates that roughly a million businesses here routinely send money overseas to full-time and contract employees. during an interview with usa today, hinrikus confirmed that while the company generates roughly $6 million a month in revenue thanks to nearly $1 billion in monthly transfers, the company is not yet profitable. and he's not concerned. ""we have plenty of money,"" he says, noting that while transferwise isn't on the hunt for more funding, he is glad that the connection to plugged-in valley players such as marc andreessen means ""we know what's going on with the funding ecosystem even if we aren't looking."" asked about andreessen's influence on the company's mission, hinrikus laughs. ""it's not like we weren't thinking big when we founded the company,"" he says. ""but if we were thinking global, they're thinking intergalactic."" that's likely because of the size of the pie that transferwise is slicing into. ""there are about 200 million people who live or study abroad,"" he says. ""that might be a small niche in terms of banking, but that group is moving many trillions of dollars a year. in the u.s. last year, we moved $2 billion, saving customers $100 million in bank fees. that's real money going back into the economy."" hinrikus says transferwise's biggest market is the united kingdom, where it has 8% market share (compared to less than 1% globally). when it comes to safeguarding those transfers in an age of increased hacking, hinrikus says his company is diving deep into machine learning algorithms that can detect potentially fraudulent activities.

" on tv and off, that desire to feel that the story being told applies to us -- that we're part of it or can learn from it -- is simply human nature. we all want to see ourselves represented and validated; we all want tv to acknowledge our place in the national community. yet the call for inclusivity, particularly when it's being aimed at the broadcast networks, is more than just a desire or demand. in an increasingly diverse and sometimes divided nation, it's a necessity. despite what the networks might want to believe, merely adding some token black best friend, asian tech expert or latina housemaid to an otherwise  white cast is not enough -- and for good reason. when a network presents an entire new slate without a single minority lead, as cbs did this fall, it sends a not-so-subtle message that minority actors are not up to the challenge; minority characters are not worthy of our attention; and minorities themselves are not capable of being more than supporting players in a society run by white men. that kind of television whiteout doesn't just hurt those excluded; it hurts us all. if this election season has taught us anything, it's that we don't know enough about each other -- a lack of understanding that can only make the divisions among us grow even more dangerous. television is the most powerful and influential medium in america, and we have a right to expect the broadcast networks to use that power to help bridge those divisions. the networks, through their owned-and-operated stations and their affiliates, broadcast their shows over the public airwaves. in exchange, the fcc requires them to operate in the public interest -- a requirement the broadcast stations themselves use to justify their demand that cable companies carry them. most of the public-service burdens once placed upon those stations have long since been weakened to the point of being virtually non-existent. but the basic idea still applies, and at a bare minimum it should mean that people who use the public airwaves should be expected to reflect the public as it actually exists. no one should have to force them to do so; it's an obligation they should be smart enough to recognize on their own. any representation helps, from the african-american captain on brooklyn nine-nine to the asian-american detective on elementary. but if we're ever going to get closer to understanding one another, we also need shows in which race and ethnicity are part of the point -- shows that go beyond color-blind representation to portray our differences and similarities. what we need are more shows like jane the virgin, queen sugar, atlanta, fresh off the boat, empire and insecure. and we won't get more of them until the people in charge of making, ordering and airing television series better reflect the people out there watching them. when that happens, we all benefit. certainly there are things a white family in indiana can learn from black-ish's portrait of an upper-middle-class african-american family's life in los angeles, but there are also things a family in los angeles (black or  white) can learn from the middle's portrait of a working-class white family's life in indiana. neither, of course, is a documentary -- but both at least offer a jumping-off point for a conversation",LIFE; Pg. 3D,USA TODAY,"Diversity in TV isn't just desirable - it's necessary; Medium has power, and responsibility, to bridge divides",11/2/16

" one wrong step and you could be on the hook for a massive tax bill. miss the 60-day deadline, and you could face a complicated appeals process that could easily cost $20,000 -- that is, until now.on aug. 24 the irs changed its appeals process for those who miss the 60-day deadline. now, with one of 11 excuses -- a postal error, for example -- and some ""self-certification"" legwork, you can fix the problem yourself for free.in one fell swoop, this new guidance will save thousands of iras from the harsh bite of needless and accelerated taxation, according to jeffrey levine, chief retirement strategist with ed slott & co. levine answered our questions about the new guidance by email, edited for length and clarity. q first, what is a 60-day rollover? a: it's a process that allows a person to move money indirectly from one retirement account to another, something you might do when switching jobs or retiring, for example. in a typical 60-day rollover, a person will take a distribution from one of their retirement accounts via a check made payable to them personally. then, within 60 days, they deposit it into another retirement account. q what was the old guidance? a: prior to revenue procedure 2016-47, fixing a rollover that wasn't completed in time usually required a private letter ruling (plr) from the irs. these rulings -- almost like mini court cases with the irs as judge and jury -- were always time consuming and expensive, but they became even more so in february when the irs increased its fee to $10,000. tack on professional fees to prepare the ruling, which could easily run another $10,000, and the total cost to try and fix the problem could easily run $20,000 or more. q what changes under the new guidance? a: the plr process will largely be replaced by a self-certification process that will allow people to complete a late 60-day rollover immediately and at no cost. q what are the conditions that must be met? a: most people  need to be concerned with three rules: the late rollover must be due to one of 11 irs-provided ""excuses,"" the rollover must be completed as soon as practicable, and a written letter of certification must be provided to the receiving company. q what else do ira account owners need to know? a: the irs has indicated that they will be adjusting reporting requirements to be alerted when a late 60-day rollover is made. that could draw unwanted scrutiny to a person's tax return. q what's missing from the new guidance? a: what about relief for people who are given poor advice by a trusted adviser, but not through a financial institution? what if, for instance, a cpa read the tax code upside-down and told someone that they had 90 days to complete the rollover instead of 60? based on the language in the guidance, it appears this person would not meet any of the 11 irs-provided acceptable excuses. this seems unfair. q is there a way to avoid rollover problems altogether? a: yes.  moving money directly from one retirement account to another reduces the potential for error. this can be accomplished by having retirement money sent right from one account to another without ever handling the funds, or by having the distributing company make the check payable to the new retirement account. robert powell is editor of retirement weekly",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,IRA rollover mistakes get easier to fix,11/2/16

""some people drove from an hour away to try it,"" he said. the promotion now moves to atlanta later in the week and then on to wisconsin and minnesota. the venison comes from farm-raised red deer in new zealand because the usda won't allow restaurants to sell wild-harvested animals.

", with her two children in tow, manager julie rudnick didn't suspect a thing. and when rudnick used a counterfeit-detector pen on the $100 bill the woman paid with, the ink stayed clear -- the mark of a genuine bill. it wasn't until she took the money to her bank a couple of days later that she was told the bill was a fake. harder to detect, easier to make: this is the challenge posed by advancing technology in counterfeit money. higher resolution, better color duplication and lower prices for printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to make passable fakes. in fiscal year 2015, nearly 70% of the $78 million in counterfeit currency passed in the u.s. was made using digital printing technologies, the secret service reports. six men were sentenced last year for creating fake $100 bills so sophisticated that the counterfeiters eluded capture for 15 years. and in september, a man living in his truck in missouri was found guilty of printing over $9,000 in phony $100 bills. todd mulbarger, owner of the great clips salon in tracy and seven others in california, estimates he loses $300 to $400 a year due to counterfeits. rudnick says the damage may be even greater, considering that cashiers might not recognize fake bills and may inadvertently give them to customers with their change. once a fake is recognized as such, you won't be reimbursed, the treasury department says. you would have to eat the loss. but technology has also helped law enforcement crack down on counterfeits through improved security features, says elena quercioli, assistant professor of economics at the university of texas rio grande valley. ""think of it as a game,"" she says. ""the better they get at counterfeiting, the better we get at catching the counterfeits."" although counterfeit bills are increasingly sophisticated, mulbarger says the number of fake bills he sees at his businesses has actually dropped significantly over 20 years -- because more people are using credit cards. cash sales, which used to account for around two-thirds of his revenue, now make up about one-third.

""we got a reminder of how really difficult it is to elect a woman executive,"" said democratic pollster celinda lake, citing not just clinton's defeat  but losses by other women running for congress and in gubernatorial races. no one on official team clinton seemed to foresee the  losses she suffered in critical battlegrounds, including pennsylvania, which hadn't voted for a republican since 1988. the defeat was fueled by a strong showing among white, working-class voters. inside clinton's circle of loyalists, there was frustration that she didn't have a strong message, as reflected by a rotating series of campaign slogans. but clinton's loss is also the product of a 30-year bipartisan march toward a more globalized economy that left millions of lower-wage americans feeling left behind. democrats argue the republican-led congress has blocked many  of  obama's economic policies  that could have helped these voters. yet history says it is usually the  party in the white house that pays the  price for such deep-seated disaffection. and, deep in the polling data, warning signs were apparent. as bill clinton's chief strategist, james carville, famously said, ""it's the economy, stupid."" for instance, in nevada two weeks before the election, when asked to compare the two parties on the issues, democrats were behind republicans by double digits on the economy, said lake. ""you can't win elections as a democrat if you're not ahead on the economy,"" she said. one accomplishment clinton can point to is the fact that she won among married women. but even there, the turnout numbers were disappointing for the so-called clinton coalition. there are sure to be recriminations and soul-searching inside the democratic party for years to come, as supporters of sen. bernie sanders argue the party nominated the wrong candidate, while pollsters say democrats simply failed to show up -- despite a get-out-the-vote operation that began even before clinton launched her campaign. matt bennett, senior vice president at third way, a centrist policy shop led by democrats, said the campaign operation itself bears no blame.

"s. senate, as most of the endangered republicans managed to hold on to their seats. here are the six newly elected senators -- and one more will be added to the 2017 freshman class after louisiana's runoff in december. catherine cortez masto nevada democrat democrat catherine cortez masto's victory in the nevada senate race is groundbreaking for the silver state. she is the first woman to represent nevada in the senate and the first latino woman in the chamber's history. her paternal grandfather immigrated to nevada from chihuahua, mexico. the former two-term attorney general replaces retiring senate democratic leader harry reid. losing the seat would have been a devastating blow for democrats, though even with this win, they did not take control of the senate. cortez masto, 52, ran an aggressive campaign based on foundational democratic policy proposals -- raising the minimum wage, protecting social security and medicare, and passing a comprehensive immigration overhaul. she was the candidate whom reid handpicked to replace him after serving in the senate for nearly 30 years. reid helped to remake the face of nevada by using his power to direct federal funding to the state. cortez masto defeated republican rep. joe heck, a physician who reached the rank of brigadier general in the u.s. army reserve. outside groups poured more than $90 million into the race, and top officials from both parties were frequent visitors. cortez masto is likely to be a solid democratic vote in the senate and support party leadership. -- bill theobald tammy duckworth illinois democrat democrat tammy duckworth easily defeated incumbent republican sen. mark kirk in one of the least surprising senate victories this year. she had led by double digits in recent polls, and a majority of illinois voters in one recent survey said they thought kirk hadn't recovered enough from a stroke he suffered in 2012 to perform his senate duties. duckworth is a two-term congresswoman and veteran who lost both legs when the helicopter she was riding in was shot down in iraq in 2004. after a year-long recovery at walter reed national military medical center, she went on to serve stints as director of the illinois department of veterans affairs and as an assistant secretary at the u.s. department of veterans affairs. on capitol hill, duckworth has made veterans issues a priority, and among other initiatives, she helped pass legislation to provide resources to prevent veteran suicide. during the senate campaign, she said she would back working with russia to establish a no-fly zone in syria and putting more pressure on nato allies, including turkey, to help oust the syrian regime. duckworth said public-private partnerships should be leveraged to provide tuition-free community college vocational training, which would be a first step toward free community college for all. she backs increased investment in infrastructure. -- donovan slack kamala harris california democrat california's next senator was the front-runner from the day in january 2015 that she announced her candidacy, saying she would be ""a fighter for the next generation."" in a sense, at age 52, kamala harris is getting the first opportunity of anyone in her own generation to win a senate seat in california. barbara boxer, 75, who announced last year she wouldn't seek a fifth term, was first elected to the senate in 1992, replacing alan cranston, who was resigning after four terms. dianne feinstein, 83, was elected the same year to finish out the term of pete wilson, who had been elected governor, and has remained in the senate ever since. harris, a career prosecuting attorney before being elected and re-elected as the state's attorney general, will be the first african american and indian american to represent the golden state in the senate. she defeated 10-term rep. loretta sanchez in the democrat-vs.-democrat general election. her path to the seat was not as steep as once predicted, as former and current los angeles mayors antonio villaraigosa and eric garcetti, lt. gov. gavin newsom and billionaire environmentalist tom steyer decided not to run. as attorney general, she negotiated a settlement with bankers over illegal mortgage practices that brought billions to underwater california homeowners. she is an expert on tackling recidivism -- she wrote a book, smart on crime, about it -- and making parents responsible for truant children. as district attorney of san francisco city and county, she antagonized police when she declined to seek the death penalty for a cop killer in 2004, her first year in office. harris has a good relationship with president obama, who once described her as ""by far the best-looking attorney general in the country."" --bartholomew sullivan maggie hassan new hampshire democrat democrat maggie hassan eked out a win to unseat incumbent republican kelly ayotte in one of the tightest races in the country. hassan, 58, has been governor of new hampshire since 2013, and before that, she was a state senator for six years, including a stint as majority leader before losing re-election in 2010. during her tenure as governor, hassan maintained high job approval ratings. a morning consult poll this year gauged her support as 56% favorable and 33% unfavorable. she campaigned for the senate on a pledge to work across the aisle to make washington work better for middle-class americans and touted her prior record in new hampshire, where she froze tuition at state universities and lowered it at community colleges and passed two budgets without raising sales or income taxes. a lawyer by trade, hassan started in public service as an advocate for special-needs children after the eldest of her two children, ben, now 28, was born with cerebral palsy. her campaign said she was driven to ""ensure that children like her son ben, who experiences severe disabilities, would be fully included in their communities and have the same opportunities that all parents want for their children."" -- donovan slack chris van hollen maryland democrat sooner or later, chris van hollen was going to be a u.s. senator. the six-term congressman from maryland literally grew up in government. van hollen was born in pakistan, where his father was serving in the foreign service, and lived in several foreign outposts as a child. his father served as u.s. ambassador to sri lanka and the maldives. van hollen did his graduate studies at harvard's kennedy school of government, where he met his wife, katherine, and they both wound up with jobs on capitol hill. van hollen's first gig was working for maryland sen. charles ""mac"" mathias, a moderate republican. first elected to congress in 2002, van hollen quickly moved up the ladder of leadership among house democrats. he led the democrats' house campaign operation for the 2008 and 2010 election cycles, getting a good reputation among his colleagues for being a prodigious fundraiser. the 2006 almanac of american politics said van hollen, then still in his second house term, was ""among the many democrats in the maryland delegation interested in running for a senate seat when one comes open."" he took a pass on the 2006 race won by democrat ben cardin, but the retirement this year of 30-year sen. barbara mikulski was likely to be his last shot for a long while. the major hurdle to his promotion this year was a tough primary battle against rep. donna edwards, a more liberal african-american lawmaker who argued that van hollen would be too cozy with wall street. the race seemed close at first, but van hollen won by a more than 10% margin. in the general election, he had little trouble dispatching his republican opponent, delegate kathy szeliga, in a state where registered democrats outnumber registered republicans by 2-to-1. -- paul singer todd young indiana republican republican todd young, a former marine, won indiana's open senate seat by defeating one of the most formidable indiana politicians: evan bayh. it was not the race young had expected. after his decisive primary win in may over a tea party-backed opponent, young was set to face former congressman baron hill, the democrat he defeated in a 2010 house race. hill withdrew from the race in july, clearing the way for bayh -- a former u.s. senator with more than $9 million in leftover campaign funds -- to go after the seat being vacated by retiring republican sen. dan coats. republican leadership and outside groups -- including the u.s. chamber of commerce -- came to young's aid as they had in the primary. the election became a referendum on bayh. young and his allies accused bayh of leaving indiana behind and cashing in when, instead of seeking re-election in 2010 after voting for the affordable care act, bayh went to work for a washington law and lobbying firm and for a private equity fund. the attacks steadily eroded the good feelings hoosiers had of bayh from his two terms as senator and governor, even as young remained unknown to many voters. in the house, young had been among the minority of republicans who joined democrats in voting for a deal to end the partial government shutdown in 2013. his willingness to cast tough votes helped him win a seat on the influential ways and means committee, where he threw himself into overhauling the tax code and exploring a new way of funding social services programs",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,Meet the new U.S. senators,11/11/16
" if clinton's lead holds, she would be the second contender in modern times -- joining fellow democrat al gore in 2000 -- to win the popular vote but lose the white house by failing to amass the necessary 270 electoral votes. filmmaker and progressive activist michael moore colorfully summed up democratic feelings about trump's victory: ""the only reason he's president is because of an arcane, insane 18th century idea called the electoral college."" but those clamoring to dump the system cobbled together by the nation's founders -- which gives each state as many electoral votes as it has members of congress -- should be careful what they wish for. adopting a national popular vote would trade one set of problems for another. electoral college opponents argue that the system pushes candidates to ignore states that republicans or democrats consider sure things and focus on a dozen battleground states during the campaigns. but tuesday's election showed that the electoral college map is more fluid than many people believed. if the national popular vote were the ultimate decider, candidates would gravitate toward the voter-rich big cities and their suburbs and ignore everyone else. if candidates felt obliged to blanket the entire country with visits and advertising, it would set off a scramble for even more campaign money, leaving candidates more beholden to special interests. a popular vote contest involving multiple candidates could produce a winner with, say, only 35% of the vote, provoking an outcry to create a runoff process involving the top two vote-getters. and if the u.s. popular vote were so close that a nationwide recount were needed, the process could be a nightmare dwarfing the florida fiasco of 2000. changing the system would require amending the constitution, which is extraordinarily difficult, or doing an end run around it. a group called national popular vote has been trying to pass state laws mandating that the states' electoral votes be cast for whoever wins the u.s. popular vote. ten states and washington, d.c., representing 165 electoral votes, have signed on. the compact would take effect when it's ratified by states representing at least 270 electoral votes. this scheme sounds clever, but imagine what would happen when new yorkers, reliably democratic in presidential elections, learned that their state was casting all its electoral votes for a republican  because he or she won the popular vote. uproar is too modest a word. one idea worth examining is to shift away from winner-take-all in each state to a proportional allocation of electors based on statewide vote totals. but any change  should be both bipartisan and carefully considered. although democrats are the wounded party now, going into this election they thought they had a ""blue firewall"" that gave them a big electoral college edge",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Dump the Electoral College?

""find out how many democratic leaders have been to the states of michigan or alabama or utah,"" said sanders, the vermont independent who lost to clinton in the democratic primaries.  ""the democratic party has got to make it very clear that it is the party of working people in 50 states in this country, not just in new york and california. we've got a lot of work to do."" sanders reiterated his call for a transformation of the democratic party and said rep. keith ellison of minnesota, co-chairman of the congressional progressive caucus, a member of the congressional black caucus, and one of two muslims in the house, should lead the democratic national committee. the party must be inclusive, bringing in not only working people but women, minorities, the lgbt community and young people for their  energy and idealism, he said. and it should continue to embrace the progressive policies in its platform. ""young people can play an extraordinary role in leading this country in a new direction, as can working people who are sick and tired of being exploited,"" he said. sanders said tuesday's election results tell him the party ""has really got to make it clear to the people of this country which side they're on."" ""you cannot be a party which cozies up to wall street, which raises money from billionaires, and be a party of working families,"" sanders said. ""the simple truth -- and mr. trump tapped into this -- is that millions of american are working longer hours for lower wages, they're worried to death about the future for their children and they want an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1percent."" clinton's loss reignited talk among sanders supporters about whether he would have fared better against trump in this anti-establishment election. pollster frank luntz, speaking wednesday on the cbs morning news, said voters preferred sanders over trump by eight points in a tuesday survey of 1,200 voters, many of whom cited ""character"" as the reason. asked whether he thinks he could have won, sanders said, ""monday morning quarterbacking is very easy. ""the answer is, i don't know. i don't think anybody knows. but i am sorry i did not have the opportunity to make that effort."" sanders said his staff is busy assembling a list of trump's promises to hold him accountable on job creation, higher wages, prescription drug price decreases and college affordability. he doesn't think trump will follow through on pledges to help the working class, and he told the associated press, ""i hope i'm wrong, but i believe he is a fraud."" sanders said he will work with trump if he advances new trade policies that create american jobs or seeks to make college affordable or rebuild the country's infrastructure. ""i will vigorously oppose him when he comes up with racist or sexist or xenophobic policies to try to divide this country up,"" sanders said. during his campaign, trump used some of sanders' material from the primary, including sanders' questioning of clinton's judgment. asked whether he felt responsible for the election's outcome, sanders said he doesn't. in fact, he said, clinton used the issues he raised during the campaign to her advantage. for instance, her embrace  of a sanders proposal to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for the middle class was ""one of the strongest positions and most popular positions that she brought forth,"" he said. sanders, sounding slightly hoarse, said he campaigned for clinton in 12 states last week, spoke to 20,000 people and delivered 18 speeches for her. he campaigned in a number of other states for her before that. in the end, he said, clinton lost for several reasons, including turnout and an enthusiasm gap.

""i believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face,"" obama said. in pledging a smooth transition, obama told trump, ""we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed, then the country succeeds."" trump -- noting that the meeting ran long -- said, ""mr. president, it was a great honor being with you, and i look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future."" the new york businessman said: ""we had never met each other. i have great respect."" the two shook hands for the cameras but did not take questions from reporters. heading into the meeting, obama and trump struck conciliatory notes in the wake of tuesday's surprising election results, following a campaign of searing rhetoric. ""it's time for america to bind the wounds of division,"" trump said during his victory speech early wednesday. obama is ""quite sincere about fulfilling the basic responsibility that he has to the american people and our democracy to ensure a smooth transition to the next presidency,"" white house spokesman josh earnest said. after the meeting, earnest said the two leaders did not resolve all of their differences, but they weren't trying to; their focus was a smooth transition. trump followed the meeting by heading to capitol hill to meet with another key player in his emerging presidency, republican house speaker paul ryan. the vice president-elect, mike pence, attended the session with ryan, who, like obama, has had his share of differences with trump. afterward, ryan said, ""we had a fantastic, productive meeting about getting to work."" the president-elect met with another powerful republican, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky. asked about his talks with lawmakers, trump said: ""we have a lot to do. we're going to work very strongly on immigration, health care, and we're looking at jobs, big-league jobs."" gearing up for his inauguration jan. 20, trump started to speak on the phone with an array of leaders from across the globe, from japan to turkey. british prime minister theresa may congratulated trump on his victory and reminded the new york businessman of his ""commitment in his acceptance speech to uniting people across america, which she said is a task we all need to focus on globally,"" according to a statement from may's office. trump invited may to visit him as soon as possible, the statement said. another world leader, canadian prime minister justin trudeau, announced his government is prepared to renegotiate parts of the north american free trade agreement with canada. during his campaign, trump said free-trade deals have shipped jobs overseas. the trump team is putting together possible picks for the cabinet and white house staff. while obama and trump spoke in the oval office, first lady michelle obama gave a tour of the residence to melania trump. during the campaign, michelle obama criticized trump over his lewd comments about women. during her address to the republican national convention, melania trump used lines that repeated parts of a speech the first lady had once given. in preparing for his sit-down with trump, president obama said ""it is no secret"" that they have ""some pretty significant differences."" but the president said he'd also had differences with his predecessor, george w. bush, and they had a smooth transition. he said he has instructed aides to ""follow the example that president bush's team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect."" one trump backer and obama critic, former house speaker newt gingrich, described the meeting between the president and his successor as ""an amazing tribute to the power of the people."" trump spent much of his insurgent campaign pledging to reverse and tear down obama's legacy. he called for repealing and replacing the president's health care law, voiding the iran nuclear deal and ripping up new business and environmental regulations. on the stump, trump criticized obama for campaigning so much on behalf of democratic nominee hillary clinton, saying he should ""do the job he's supposed to be doing."" in his campaign speeches, obama cast trump as an erratic and perhaps unstable political novice who shouldn't be allowed near the nuclear codes.

" the troops came forward after the pentagon's policy allowing the open service of transgender troops went into effect oct. 1. about 55 enlisted sailors and officers have informed their commanders they want to transition to the other gender, according to lt. cmdr. nate christensen, a navy spokesman. there are 48 airmen who seek transgender medical care or counseling, said maj. william lewis, an air force spokesman. in october, army chief of staff gen. mark milley told the associated press that 10 soldiers had formally sought to be recognized in their new gender. sailors were informed monday about the transgender sailors and urged to abide by the new policy, according to an email from the navy's chief of personnel. ""today, we know of approximately 55 sailors who have waited for this policy to be finalized and desire a gender transition,"" vice adm. robert burke wrote in an email to commanders obtained by usa today. ""with few exceptions, these sailors have had faith that the navy would come through, and they observed all regulations and standards applicable to their birth gender."" the exceptions  are sailors who sought treatment before the policy was finalized, said a navy official who spoke on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to speak publicly about details of those seeking treatment. burke's message accompanied the navy's new policy for transgender sailors. ""we would ask that your leaders assist our sailors in conforming to navy regulations and uphold navy standards of conduct as we navigate this change,"" burke wrote. the pentagon's repeal of the ban on transgender troops was announced june 30 after months of internal debate. some members of the military brass  feared the change was  too quick. marine gen. joseph dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, did not appear with defense secretary ash carter when the repeal was announced. transgender troops are estimated to make up a small fraction of the active-duty force of 1.3million. a rand corp. study found there are as many as 6,630 transgender troops, dozens of whom would seek hormone treatment or surgery. the cost of treating them was estimated at as much as $8.4 million per year. individual treatment could cost as much as $50,000. transgender sailors must first prove to medical personnel that transition is medically necessary before treatment begins, according to guidance issued to commanders. the navy defined treatment that includes ""real-life experience,"" which could include wearing clothing of the opposite gender or hairstyle during off-duty hours, according to guidance issued to commanders. the process could lead to hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. ""to remain the finest seagoing fighting force the world has ever known, the navy needs people who are the right fit for the right job, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, creed or gender identity,"" christensen said.

" 28 until after his inauguration in january, his attorney told a judge on thursday, two days after trump was elected president. when the judge asked why, trump's attorney, daniel petrocelli, summed it up like this: ""in view of mr. trump's election as president of the united states, your honor."" petrocelli also questioned whether trump actually would be available to testify in court as a sitting president. he said never has there been a case in the history of the united states in which a president had to come into court to testify in a trial as a defendant. trump might testify by video instead. ""his obligations right now are just monumental,"" petrocelli told u.s. district court judge gonzalo curiel. curiel said he understood and said it would be wise for the two sides to settle the case, a class-action fraud lawsuit involving trump and his now-defunct trump university. the lawsuit was filed in 2010 on behalf of former trump university customers, who alleged that trump university failed on its promise to teach success in real estate. they claim they were ripped off and lost tens of thousands of dollars after being misled about it. at curiel's suggestion, petrocelli said he was open to the help of another federal judge, jeffrey miller, in trying to find a way to settle before trial. ""i can tell you right now i'm all ears,"" petrocelli told curiel. petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by monday. after court thursday, petrocelli told reporters trump wanted to testify in person before his election as president. ""now he's going to have to take into account whether that's the best use of his time, and he has to weigh his desire to be here against the needs of the country right now,"" petrocelli said. curiel didn't say how he would rule but said he expects the case to last into mid-december if it starts as scheduled. an attorney for the plaintiffs, jason forge, told usa today after the hearing that he didn't think the request for a delay got any traction with curiel. ""it's hard to say a sitting president is less busy or more expendable than a president-elect,"" forge said. earlier in the day, curiel tentatively denied a request to ban statements made by and about trump during his campaign from being used as evidence, including his tweets and speeches. it was all bit of surreal scene -- and it's just getting started. not only was the defendant just elected the nation's 45th president, but the judge is curiel, whose fairness in the case previously was questioned by trump because of his mexican heritage. trump previously called him ""a hater"" and described his actions as ""a total disgrace.""

" donald trump stormed the blue wall tuesday, parlaying victories in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania into the presidency. he did it on a tide of votes from rural and blue-collar whites. he was helped by clinton's neglect of the region and her failure to fully mobilize her party's own base, including young voters and african americans. ""donald trump brought a new calculation, a new way of winning (these states), but part of that was her colossal failure,"" gop pollster gene ulm said. ""she did not turn out and galvanize the obama coalition."" in wisconsin, where clinton didn't make a single stop during the general election campaign, she won voters under 30 by just 4 points. obama won them by 23 points four years ago. the state voted republican for the first time since 1984. ""the vote among younger voters dropped off appreciably"" for clinton, said tom holbrook, political scientist for the university of wisconsin-milwaukee. clinton's margin in the ultra-blue city of milwaukee was 27,000 votes smaller than obama's. that was roughly the size of her statewide defeat. though clinton may not have put a ton of resources into wisconsin, her campaign peppered michigan with visits by her and her surrogates during the final weeks. still, in detroit, she won roughly 50,000 fewer votes than obama did in 2012. ""it's is nothing short of malpractice that her campaign didn't look at the electoral college and put substantial resources in states like michigan and wisconsin,"" democratic pollster paul maslin said. neither president obama nor the first lady was dispatched to wisconsin, either. wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania were each decided by about 1 percentage point. trump connects in wisconsin, trump got roughly the same number of votes -- 1.4 million -- that mitt romney got while losing the state in 2012. the key was that clinton got almost a quarter-million fewer votes than obama, paving the way for trump victory in a race where turnout lagged the previous four presidential races in the state. in michigan, trump outperformed romney, a native michigander, in blue-collar macomb county, known as the home of the reagan democrat. he outpaced clinton in other regions of the state, vowing to secure america's borders and return michigan to its manufacturing heyday. her share of the vote in wayne county, home to detroit, was 6 percentage points lower than obama's. michigan went republican for the first time since 1988. in pennsylvania, exit polls measured the african-american vote at 13% of the electorate in 2012 but 10% in 2016. again, clinton did not turn out her base of support in the volume needed to hold back trump. maslin said blue-collar and middle-class whites in northern states have been a ""swinging gate"" in u.s. elections, shifting back and forth between the parties. ""the gate swung all the way open, and donald trump walked right through,"" he said. maslin said democrats failed to connect with these voters' economic concerns. ""it could be a big-time, long-term problem that donald trump may have exploited and hillary clinton may have been ill-equipped to prevent, but now we're left with it."" 'disenchanted' in michigan, part of the drop in voter turnout in democratic and predominantly african-american detroit was the function of population shift. detroit's financial troubles -- it went through the largest municipal bankruptcy in u.s. history a few years ago -- have been well documented, and it's been losing population for decades. where about 925,000 people lived in detroit in the early 2000s, that number is down to about 680,000, according to census estimates. some residents said they sensed apathy, even distaste, for clinton's campaign. ""from what i saw, a lot of african americans did not go out to vote,"" said wilfred blackmon, 70, president of a residents group of 3,000 homes on detroit's blue-collar northwest side. blackmon, a clinton supporter, said he'd voted in every election since he was 18. a few weeks ago, blackmon heard nation of islam leader louis farrakhan on the radio. farrakhan ""was disenchanted with hillary. he went back to the days of bill clinton and the increased incarceration of black people,"" blackmon said. ""a lot of people listen to him."" jocelyn harris, a democratic party precinct delegate on detroit's lower east side, said she and all her family members turned out to vote for clinton. harris said she and others in her area of 2,600 homes -- the jefferson-chalmers district -- suffered two basement backups of sewage-tainted storm water over the summer. dealing with those problems preoccupied her and several neighbors, so harris and other party regulars didn't go door-to-door to get out the vote this fall as they had four years ago, she said. ""we didn't get really engaged this time,"" harris said. there was some pushback wednesday to the idea that detroit -- and specifically african americans -- somehow let clinton down. ""black voters did what they always do. they turn out for the democratic party,"" said jonathan kinloch, the democratic party's chair of the 13th congressional district, composed of detroit's west and southwest sides, as well as 10 blue-collar suburbs. kinloch said the larger issue was  ""the conversation that the clinton campaign needed to have with the souls of white america"" and white voters' ""counter-response to the first african-american president."" jon zurinsky, 34, of sterling heights in macomb county said he voted for trump ""because he's not hillary. i don't like her."" zurinsky, who said he voted for barack obama once, said clinton sends ""everything across seas,"" and ""hopefully, trump will try to bring everything back,"" particularly jobs",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,'Blue wall' crumbled for Clinton; Trump snatched region's rural vote while she focused energy elsewhere,11/11/16
" california billionaire tom steyer, who directed more than $60 million of his fortune to help persuade voters to turn out for democrats, saw the gop sweep to control of the white house and both chambers of congress. the 2016 elections became the latest in a string of volatile federal elections to challenge long-standing notions about the role of money in politics. the 2010 midterm congressional races, for instance, saw upstart tea party candidates topple well-funded incumbents around the country as voters grappled with a tough economy and concerns about the affordable care act. money can help in a competitive race, but ""it can't make up for a sea change in the views of the electorate,"" said fred malek, a veteran republican fundraiser who is finance chairman of the republican governors association. but the 2016 president contest marks the first time since the 1996 showdown between bob dole and bill clinton showdown in which the president-elect has raised less money than his rival, according to a review by the non-partisan center for responsive politics. from the start, trump took an unorthodox approach to fundraising. the real-estate magnate did not start raising money in earnest until late may, and he pumped about $66 million of his own cash into the contest. when several of his gop rivals flew to a southern california resort last year to court conservative billionaire charles koch and his network of super-rich donors, trump taunted them on twitter as ""puppets"" there to ""beg for money."" in the final months of the campaign, trump collaborated with the republican national committee on high-dollar fundraising events, but his long-shot bid also was fueled by small donors. contributions of $200 or less accounted for about 64% of his total donations from others. by contrast, about 26% of clinton's donations through oct. 19 came in amounts that small. ""we had enough money and the right candidate. it's as simple as that,"" said lewis eisenberg, the republican national committee's finance chairman. ""secretary clinton had all the money, all the hollywood talent, most of the media and everything else with her. the united states of america and the citizens of this country are too smart,"" he said. ""it's not a one-element equation. he had the message that was resonating in the country."" although outside groups helping clinton far outspent those backing trump, a small cluster of wealthy republicans did emerge to help in the campaign's final months. hedge-fund billionaire robert mercer, for instance, funded a super pac that ran digital ads targeting clinton. diane hendricks, wisconsin's richest woman, put millions more into another committee that ran ads attacking clinton and democrat senate contender russ feingold in the badger state. both democrats lost wisconsin. steyer was the democratic party's top super pac donor as of mid-october and sought to mobilize voters who care about the environment and other liberal issues to vote. in an interview wednesday, steyer said he accomplished several of his goals, including boosting turnout among millennial voters in parts of key battleground states",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,How Trump won on half of what Clinton spent; 2016 election latest in a series to challenge notions of role of money in politics,11/11/16
" in september 2015, trump said he would ""renegotiate"" the agreement, reached two months earlier, which curtailed iran's nuclear program to peaceful activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions over time. last month, trump said iran ""should write us a letter of thank you"" for ""the stupidest deal of all time."" vice president-elect mike pence said the deal would be ""ripped up"" after consultation with u.s. allies. could trump shred it if he wants to? yes, state department spokesman mark toner confirmed. ""the agreement is valid only as long as all parties uphold it,"" he said wednesday. the threats from trump and his team were enough to prompt iranian president hassan rouhani and foreign minister javad zarif to issue statements about the future of the agreement, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa. it cannot be changed by one government's decision, rouhani insisted wednesday. ""iran exercised prudence concerning the nuclear agreement as it confirmed jcpoa as a u.n. security council resolution, not as an agreement with one government,"" he said, according to the government-controlled iranian students news agency. the nuclear deal was reached between the united states, russia, britain, france and china -- the five permanent members of the united nations security council -- plus germany. all approved it. zarif urged the american president-elect to face the reality of regional and international affairs. the reality is that iran was brought to the bargaining table with the help of sanctions imposed by the united states, the u.n. security council and the european union at the urging of the obama administration and congress. russia, china and u.s. allies in europe have started doing business with oil-rich iran since the deal was inked, and they hope for more. european countries have lifted sanctions. iran has made deals to expand its oil fields, build cars and buy dozens of aircraft from the eu's airbus and boeing in the usa. russia is deploying anti-aircraft systems to iran. the united states released its hold on tens of billions of dollars in iranian oil revenue that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts. iran's once depressed economy is enjoying a moderate recovery. iran has expanded its policy of supporting shiite militias in iraq, yemen, syria and lebanon. in iraq, the militias are battling the islamic state, a sunni group that both shiite-dominated iran and the unitd states consider an enemy. in syria, the militias are mostly fighting u.s.-backed anti-government rebels, and in yemen, they're fighting the u.s.- and saudi-backed government. pulling out of the deal could risk exacerbating these conflicts or lifting the constraints on iran's nuclear program when it is expanding its economy and military activities abroad. toner said state department officials will explain the merits of the deal to trump's transition team, though any decision about sticking to the terms of the agreement would be up to the next administration. secretary of state john kerry and the obama administration ""feel very strongly the iran deal has worked,"" toner said. ""it prevented iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in a short period of time."" it provided for increased and more intrusive monitoring by the u.n. nuclear watchdog, the international atomic energy agency, he said. the agreement required the approval of lawmakers from every country that signed it, including the gop-controlled u.s. congress and the iranian parliament. if trump announced he would not honor the agreement, ""all u.s",NEWS; Pg. 10A,USA TODAY,"Trump could trash Iran deal, but it would be complicated; As a candidate, he derided nuclear agreement as 'the stupidest deal of all time'",11/11/16

" legislation that passed both houses of congress last year before it was vetoed by president obama would have left more than 20 million people without insurance as it would have eliminated the subsidies to help them pay for it, the penalties if they don't buy it and the taxes to cover the costs. that's something neither party is likely to vote for without the assurance of a presidential veto, says health care economist john goodman, who advises republican members of congress. ""everyone's really looking toward how the trump administration will be filling in the gaps"" of what's known about his health care policy preferences, says benjamin isgur, leader of health care consulting firm pwc's health research institute. ""if it's 'repealing and replacing,' how exactly would that be defined? what about the parts of the aca that tend to be very popular?"" these provisions include the prohibition against those with preexisting health conditions and the ability to keep children on parents' health insurance until they are 26. while neither republicans nor democrats want to take away affordable insurance from millions of people, goodman says fixing the law is a challenge even with republicans in control of congress and the white house. ""everyone knows it needs to be changed, but democrats can't be seen as voting to abolish obamacare and republicans can't be seen by their voters as voting for something that makes it better,"" says goodman. ""both parties have a base, so they cannot do something that the base regards as treason."" so what's more likely to happen are changes including elimination of the mandate that everyone have insurance, possible tax credits for those and block grants that would give states more flexibility to design their own medicaid programs. that would likely please many consumers who are eligible for few, if any, subsidies to cut their insurance costs. that includes maureen doherty of st. louis. who was wondering on election day morning what she could do about the high cost of her aca exchange choices other than ""move out of the country."" after voting for obama in 2008, the registered democrat said the effect of aca's cost on people like her prompted doherty to vote for republican mitt romney in 2012 and trump in this election. but doherty, 63, wouldn't consider going without insurance even though she is in ""excellent health."" many of the people who gained affordable coverage under the aca will continue to want to rely on the individual market, which is ""currently their best option for coverage,"" says katherine hempstead, who directs the insurance coverage team at the robert wood johnson foundation. goodman says allowing the exchanges to operate with far fewer regulations would make them more efficient. unlike many more conservative republicans, however, he doesn't favor dropping the subsidies for out-of-pocket costs that make insurance more affordable for those who make between 11% and 250% of the federal poverty limit or removing all of the coverage requirements. some, such as those for maternity and mental health benefits, predated the aca. many republicans support dropping the requirement that everyone but the lowest-income people have insurance. legislation introduced by rep. pete sessions, r-texas, and sen. bill cassidy r-la., would treat insurance more like medicare and dramatically increase the cost for those who don't sign up when they are 65. without the mandate and the tax credits that make insurance more affordable for the 84% of consumers who get them, insurance would be more expensive than it is now, says hempstead",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Policy experts doubt we'll see full repeal of Obamacare; Many key parts of health care law will be hard to vote against without the assurance of a veto, they say",11/11/16

""we expect more domestically focused economies, such as china, thailand and indonesia, to be less affected."" hospitals. trump's effect on health care is largely yet to be determined, but investors are already assuming the worst for hospitals. seeing the repeal of obamacare will likely increase the number of uninsured patients going to hospitals, which will be a cost for them. tenet healthcare (thc) is the second-worst-performing stock in the s&p 1500 since trump won, declining 28%. in fact, health care facilities companies account for four of the 15 worst-performing stocks since the election, which is more than any other industry. investors' fears may prove overblown, though.  trump's plans to lower corporate tax rates might encourage tech companies holding cash overseas to bring it to the u.s",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Trump's enemies are already paying the price; Tech stocks, hospitals could be impacted by new administration",11/11/16

""this man is so unpredictable. that money that i had in investments was for my daughter's future, and it might be wiped clean. i'm devastated.'' after initial fears of market volatility, the dow jones industrial average has steadily risen 2.6% since its election day close. in a survey taken three weeks before tuesday's elections, the national retail federation found that over 25% of shoppers said the contest would affect their holiday spending plans, and 43% said they were being more careful in regard to their spending because of the questions looming over the white house race.

""i think it's a major question,'' lawrence said about the economy. ""our economy starts to go, and our moral fiber is already gone, so what's left?'' steve barr, u.s. retail and consumer leader for consultants pwc, said that the continued rise of online retailers plus the potential for warmer winter weather that keeps people from taking refuge in malls are more likely to dampen sales than political outcomes.

"s. predicts quick action by the next president to roll back obama administration policies opposed by the oil and natural gas industry. ""there are so many of them. you just scrap them,"" harold hamm, the billionaire ceo of continental resources, said wednesday, hours after trump's surprising win over democrat hillary clinton. ""there's five times the regulation on our industry than there was before the obama administration,"" hamm said in an interview. ""i mean, it's just been a pile-on."" among the policies opposed by hamm and other producers is a proposal by the environmental protection agency to curb emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide, from oil and gas operations. ""it's like we're out to pollute the world with methane gas,"" hamm complained, disputing assertions by advocates of the policy that the industry hasn't done enough to capture the emissions. ""that's not the case,"" he said. ""it's never been the case."" that's just one of many energy policies that trump, a climate skeptic, could target quickly using his executive authority, clearview energy partners, a washington consulting group, said in a note wednesday. for example, the trump administration could come to the rescue of two controversial oil pipeline projects, including granting an easement to the dakota access pipeline, a $3.7 billion project that would carry crude oil from north dakota, where continental resources is a major player, to an illinois refinery. the project is stalled in north dakota in the face of opposition by the standing rock sioux tribe and its supporters, who say the project would destroy ancient tribal artifacts and potentially pollute waterways. likewise, trump's administration could approve a new cross-border permit for the keystone xl pipeline, a transcanada corp. initiative to ship oil from canada to the u.s. that obama rejected last year. other potential pro-industry actions at the disposal of the new administration include resuming periodic oil and gas leasing on federal lands, revising or abandoning energy department requirements for exporting liquefied natural gas and suspending securities and exchange commission rules requiring companies to disclose risks posed by climate change, according to clearview. ""people are going to use oil and gas,"" hamm said. ""so, if we don't develop our own, you're back on foreign oil."" as for oil  prices, hamm expects ""stability"" as trump aims to open more federal land and offshore waters to drilling, curb regulations and support exports of u.s. crude. as hamm spoke, the price of west texas intermediate crude oil was on a roller-coaster ride, falling 2.6% to $43.80 a barrel just after midnight wednesday, then rising 4.2% to $45.67 at noon. hamm's remarks come as speculation continues that he may be a candidate for energy secretary in the trump administration. would one of the wealthiest men in america take a $200,000-a-year job running an agency which, despite its name, is primarily responsible for administering and cleaning up after the nation's nuclear weapons? ""i have not explored that at all,"" hamm said. ""i've got a company to run."" nonetheless, hamm, who has advised trump informally on energy throughout the candidate's campaign for the white house, and said he spoke to him as recently as a couple of weeks ago, intends to step up to assist the trump transition team.

""getting such visas is, however, subject to conditions,"" said guiton, such as requiring a minimum amount of funds invested in the business, employing a certain number of local residents and ensuring the entrepreneur physically remain in the country for a set period of time. why would an entrepreneur want to leave america now? first, businesses -- including small businesses -- crave predictability. when conditions are stable, investors are more likely to fund new and expanding companies, lenders extend credit more easily, companies increase hiring, introduce new products, open new locations. but no one -- not even his most ardent supporters -- has ever claimed donald trump was predictable. an impulsive chief executive with a same-party congress and possibly supportive supreme court may indicate increasingly unstable, erratic business conditions. moreover, during the election, trump repeatedly indicated his antipathy to forces that encourage innovation, such as global trade, support for science and technology and net neutrality. as a result, many cutting-edge business people and entrepreneurs may feel now is a good time to seek greener pastures. some entrepreneurs who are immigrants or members of racial or religious minorities may feel safer with the security of another country's residency, fearing that the hostility some trump supporters expressed during the campaign may translate into public policy, increased discrimination or harassment. looking at entrepreneur and investor programs in a few english-speaking countries shows that some american business owners, especially highly desirable entrepreneurs, have other options. canada. canada's start-up visa program enables entrepreneurs who are able to secure at least $200,000 cad from specific canadian venture capitalists or $75,000 cad from angel investor groups or to be accepted in canadian incubators to gain permanent residence for up to five foreign nationals. you must be able to prove you're competent to run the company, must locate it in canada (in a province other than quebec), be proficient in english and/or french  and have sufficient funds to relocate your family. britain. the u.k. tier 1 entrepreneur visa is available to those who have at least 50,000 british pounds (approximately $62,000) to invest in their business, can speak english and can support themselves. australia. it's somewhat harder to get an entrepreneurial visa in australia. you must receive at least $200,000 aud in funding, be under 55 years of age, be competent in english, have a business that meets certain criteria and have a business plan. ireland. ireland is  aggressive in attracting foreign businesses.  one program of special interest is the start-up entrepreneur programme",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,How you can flee USA: Look to land a small-business visa,11/11/16
" it's a plotline that 2016 voters would recognize, but the candidate was richard nixon. nixon never strayed from controversy when he took office in 1969 and held the job until 1974, when he resigned in the wake of the watergate scandal. the presidential library that bears his name has just undergone a $15 million renovation, transforming it to show how nixon's life unfolded against the backdrop of tumult of late 20th-century america. with the formal reopening last month, the museum becomes a video-centric, cutting-edge experience. to a degree they never did before, displays tell the story of a man who rose from a humble california upbringing to attain america's highest office. he saw the dream ripped apart through his own failings and then ultimately came to peace with his life as an author and elder statesman. now under the auspices of the national archives, the richard nixon library and museum has plenty to offer to both those who reviled  and those who revered the 37th president. the watergate scandal is given a full airing right along with nixon's grandest achievements: reopening diplomatic ties with  china, the moon landing and protracted efforts to end the vietnam war. though sure to appeal to those who lived through the nixon era, the museum now is a multimedia experience that takes dead aim at attracting a new generation of history buffs: millennials. the new exhibit marks ""an opportunity to educate a whole new generation,"" says david ferriero, archivist of the u.s., who was on hand for the opening celebrations. text-heavy displays have been ditched in favor of video. guests are repeatedly invited to try touch screens or other interactive displays. one screen, for instance, invites guests to see where the microphones were  placed in each room of the white house as part of a secret eavesdropping system. the tape recordings of nixon and cohorts discussing watergate led directly to his downfall. instead of just peering from behind a velvet rope into a re-creation of the oval office, a fixture in some of the nation's presidential libraries, nixon's museum invites visitors to wander in and explore. they can stroll across the blue carpeting embossed with the presidential seal -- nixon  reportedly was the first to have it -- sit on the facing gold couches or behind nixon's desk. it's what was called the wilson desk, although historians are quick to point out that woodrow wilson apparently never used it. taken as a whole, the exhibits portray nixon as a complex man  full of contradictions. he was a stalwart republican, yet he founded federal agencies such as  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency,  entities sometimes taken to task by conservatives. nixon built his political career on virulent opposition to communism, yet he became the first president to visit moscow and opened ties to the world's largest communist regime, china. he racked up an enormous re-election victory in 1972, yet was undone by a bungled burglary at the opposing party's  headquarters in the watergate complex in washington. the man who declared ""i've never been a quitter"" became the only president to resign in disgrace. ""everyone has a one-dimensional view of richard nixon -- watergate, resignation and the end,"" says  craig hanna, chief creative officer for the thinkwell group, which  helped reimagine the library in its first overhaul since opening in 1990. yet, he says, few had any idea that nixon was as interesting as he was or the key role he played in a number of events. nixon's contradictions are on display from the start. visitors are ushered into a theater for a short film about nixon's life. as if to say the museum has nothing to hide, the film opens with watergate and the resignation. then it circles back to cover the other key events in nixon's life, from his birth in 1913 in the simple clapboard house on the property to his death in 1994. president  clinton eulogized him, with four former presidents in attendance, at the funeral. the exhibit takes the same unusual chronological path. rather than starting the tour in the birthplace house, visitors dive right into events leading up to the start of nixon's term. it's 1968 and the country is in upheaval. the rev. martin luther king jr. and robert f. kennedy have been assassinated. america's cities are shaken by race riots and anti-war demonstrations. into the vortex steps nixon in a monumental comeback after losing the presidency to john f. kennedy in 1960 and the california governorship  in 1962. it is only after  watergate and the resignation that the exhibits return, almost abruptly, to nixon's early years in southern california. there are his service in the navy, early fights for a seat in congress and his two terms as vice president under dwight eisenhower. there are the nixon-kennedy televised debates and his narrow loss in that election. it follows nixon into what he described as his ""wilderness years"" when he was forced to take account of himself and forge a comeback. much the same occurred a decade later, after he resigned the presidency.

" other contributing factors include a last-minute letter from fbi director james comey that raised alarms about the investigation into her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. finally, there was an unmistakable gender dynamic. ""we got a reminder of how really difficult it is to elect a woman executive,"" said democratic pollster celinda lake, citing not just clinton's defeat  but losses by other women running for congress and in gubernatorial races. no one on official team clinton seemed to foresee the  losses she suffered in critical battlegrounds, including pennsylvania, which hadn't voted for a republican since 1988. the defeat was fueled by a strong showing among white, working-class voters. inside clinton's circle of loyalists, there was frustration that she didn't have a strong message, as reflected by a rotating series of campaign slogans. but clinton's loss is also the product of a 30-year bipartisan march toward a more globalized economy that left millions of lower-wage americans feeling left behind. democrats argue the republican-led congress has blocked many  of  obama's economic policies  that could have helped these voters. yet history says it is usually the  party in the white house that pays the  price for such deep-seated disaffection. and, deep in the polling data, warning signs were apparent. as bill clinton's chief strategist, james carville, famously said, ""it's the economy, stupid."" for instance, in nevada two weeks before the election, when asked to compare the two parties on the issues, democrats were behind republicans by double digits on the economy, said lake. ""you can't win elections as a democrat if you're not ahead on the economy,"" she said. one accomplishment clinton can point to is the fact that she won among married women. but even there, the turnout numbers were disappointing for the so-called clinton coalition. there are sure to be recriminations and soul-searching inside the democratic party for years to come, as supporters of sen. bernie sanders argue the party nominated the wrong candidate, while pollsters say democrats simply failed to show up -- despite a get-out-the-vote operation that began even before clinton launched her campaign. matt bennett, senior vice president at third way, a centrist policy shop led by democrats, said the campaign operation itself bears no blame.

" by night, he's the nation's first president, george washington, in broadway smash hamilton. sunday marks his last performance in the musical, which opened off broadway in february 2015. but on a late-october friday, usa today followed him on one of his last really busy days. at home in a westchester county suburb, his son c.j., 11, left his lunch at home, while daughter jadelyn, 7, forgot her eyeglasses. so dad and mom, singer veronica vazquez-jackson, made separate trips to provide them. around 9:30, he arrived at bull's brooklyn studio and went into makeup for his scene with guest star yara martinez (jane the virgin). 10:05 a.m. jackson, nattily attired in a purple and black plaid suit and pea-green loafers, is on the set rehearsing a scene in his glass-walled office, which features a makeup mirror. in this episode, scheduled to air in early december, martinez guest-stars as isabella colon, a lifestyle guru who is sued by the victim of a bee-pollen allergy in her nutrition drinks. (she also happens to be the ex-wife of bull, who's based on the early career of talk-show host dr. phil mcgraw.) and chunk seeks to make her more approachable to jurors by selecting a demure outfit. 10:20 after several takes, he calls for a line from a script supervisor, something he can't do on stage: ""with hamilton, at this point if you're thinking about what you're going to say, something's horribly wrong. everybody knows the songs, so you have an audience full of human teleprompters."" bull marks the theater veteran's first role as a series regular, though he has had several shots as a guest star, including  stints on cbs' the good wife and person of interest in 2014. 11:28 jackson wraps the scene and heads to his dressing room. ""once we're done with a scene, it's gone."" shooting television, ""the camera is the only audience you really have, and five weeks later you see what really came about."" with hamilton fame fueling interest, he auditioned for several pilots last spring, and bull was among the last.  through prior arrangement, his scenes on hamilton days are scheduled for mornings. ""most often  when you're on a tv show, they need to have all of you,"" he says, but ""they get how important it is for me to finish out my run. i've joked for years i want to land a tv show so i can finance my theater habit."" now that hamilton has taught him how to say goodbye, ""we get more chris jackson, which we love,"" says weatherly, adding his role will expand. ""sorry for all the hamilton fans who don't get to see him as george washington."" 1:44 p.m. in jeans, a cap, air jordans and a navy coat, he leaves the studio for a few hours of midday rest at home. sometimes he hits the gym, or he'll catch up on scripts before heading south to broadway's richard rodgers theater. 6:15 he arrives at hamilton for an 8 p.m. performance, one of five he typically does each week (others are performed by nicholas christopher, who will take over the role permanently on nov. 15). jackson is one of a few remaining original stars of the smash musical; co-stars daveed diggs, leslie odom jr. and lin-manuel miranda left in july.

""it's rewarding, but it's very taxing. it's just so hard physically and emotionally to do it, and it just empties you out."" and by late september, juggling the two jobs left him feeling he was ""done,"" in part because of his kids: the workload ""guaranteed that i wouldn't have a day off. after about a month, i was like, 'that's going to be a problem.' i needed to be with my kids and my wife."" 7:05 network tv scripts change each week, 22 times a year. hamilton's stays the same. but that doesn't make it any easier, he says, likening it to a baseball player's swing.  ""the inner workings of that swing, the angles, the speed, the tempo is completely different every single time you pick up the bat."" 8:15 the lights go down, and hamilton goes up. jackson makes his entrance in act one's opening song. the crowd in the 1,300-seat theater roars with approval. did anyone anticipate such success when rehearsals began two years ago?

" a study suggests they got help from an unlikely source: trysts with the neighbors. evidence gleaned from dna shows our species, homo sapiens, benefited from mixing it up with neanderthals and another human relative, the denisovans. both neanderthals and denisovans were well ensconced in other parts of the world when modern humans arrived. by pairing off and having children with these not-quite-human creatures, modern humans quickly acquired dna that helped them adapt to their new homes, according to a study in this week's current biology. mixing with other species ""wasn't just some curious feature of human history,"" says study co-author joshua akey of the university of washington in seattle. ""(it) actually had consequences, and it helped our ancestors survive and reproduce."" arguably, our ancestors needed all the help they could get when they plodded out of africa, where homo sapiens first appeared roughly 200,000 years ago. those ill-equipped pioneers found themselves dealing with unfamiliar weather patterns and unfamiliar germs. they came face to face with peculiar kinds of humans who were eerily similar yet different. left to their own devices, the immigrants would've eventually evolved to fit their new territory. but that process is slow. borrowing dna from others already well-suited to local conditions would've been much quicker, akey says -- ""a way of short-circuiting the normal evolutionary process."" by screening the dna of more than 1,500 contemporary people from around the world, akey and his colleagues identified those borrowed bits of the genetic code. one from neanderthals, called oca2, affects gene and skin color. another is a fragment of neanderthal dna that strengthens the immune system's response to viruses and other potentially dangerous microbes. the researchers conducted thorough searches for outsiders' dna in four groups: europeans, east asians, south asians and melanesians. they estimate each group boasts 10 to 20 stretches of beneficial dna from close human relatives. many of those dna stretches influence either the immune system or the coloration of body parts such as skin, the researchers found. previous experiments identified bits of dna from other species that helped homo sapiens get ahead -- for example, a denisovan gene that enhances modern tibetans' ability to cope with high altitudes. the new research provides welcome confirmation of the kinds of genetic benefits that humans reaped from their relatives, says janet kelso of germany's max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology, who has collaborated with akey on previous research. the study is ""a really good place to start,"" says tony capra of vanderbilt university. his own work showed a link between some of the dna we inherited from neanderthals with higher disease risk, and he points out that even the beneficial dna from our close kin was beneficial a long, long time ago, when our circumstances were very different.

" he is quirky, fun and occasionally grumpy. what he is most, however, is therapeutic. fito and i worked as a combat tracking team in the marine corps beginning in 2008. our sole job was to track down insurgents in combat zones, and our relationship was dictated by the needs of a wartime military. that might sound disheartening, but i can assure you it was not. he and i worked at a relentless pace on a daily basis to provide support to the war effort overseas. our relationship was meaningful, but only i understood the meaning. to him, he was just blessed with a new best friend. to say that i was initially hesitant to become attached to fito would be a huge understatement. i would see him every morning with a joyful smile on his face and consciously remind myself that our relationship wasn't one of attachment but one of necessity. emotional reluctance in 2010, after 18 months of training in the desert of california, our unit was finally called upon to go to afghanistan. fito had no idea where we were going or what we were about to do, and i'm eternally grateful for that ignorance. on the long plane ride overseas, i slept on the floor of the airplane with my head nudged against the door of his kennel. he was uneasy about the loud noises, and i was uneasy about war. admittedly, it is impossible for any handler to work with a dog for that length of time and not form an attachment. i knew i would need him for comfort despite my emotional reluctance. war is emotionally, mentally and physically draining. the highest of highs and the lowest of lows can come within a matter of minutes. heraclitus said, ""the only constant in life is change,"" which makes combat eerily similar to life, albeit magnified exponentially. to fito, however, i was his constant. from his perspective, he and i were simply living somewhere new. our missions would take us directly into the line of fire, and i was envious of how oblivious he was to our surroundings. we'd return to our base after lengthy missions and, while i would be mentally assessing everything, fito would drift off to sleep by my feet almost instantaneously. we returned back home later that year. war had twisted my outlook on life and death. it had even given fito some gray hairs on his muzzle. but the most profound change was our relationship. just as i was beginning to understand the complexity and weighty nature of it, i was told fito would be sent to texas to help train new handlers without me. as a marine, i can tell you that possessing a steely reserve and unshakable bearing is at the core of our nature. as a man who loves dogs, i can tell you that it was one of the hardest things i have ever experienced. i was losing the friend i needed most. over time, i accepted fito's departure without resentment for anyone. i understood the mission in the military outweighed everything else, even the bond we had created. the end of my enlistment came in 2012, and by that time the memories of him were stored and well-preserved. i went on to work with other dogs, but fito was never far from my thoughts. on a random day then, in 2014, i received a phone call from a random number on a beautiful random day in june. the caller informed me that fito was ready to be retired and asked whether i'd be interested in adopting him. dumbstruck and tongue-tied, i was able to spit out a yes. she told me he was still living in texas about three hours away. we arranged for a time and place for me to pick him up and, in the days leading up to the reunion, a million thoughts raced through my head. would he remember me? how had time affected him? the anticipation was exhilarating and ridden with anxiety. all those questions were answered the second i saw fito and he saw me. he ran straight toward me as i knelt down to receive his embrace. my outstretched arms happily welcomed him as he barreled into my chest. i'm not certain how long i spent hugging him as he licked my face. it was one of those rare moments in life where time just seems to stop. i realized right then that time and separation couldn't weaken our relationship. more than two years later, he is my best friend just as i am his. we spend most of our days together, and i am able to appreciate both life and time better with him. the only changes in fito are a slower step and more gray hair, and i guess i have experienced the same. we are both aware of the importance of our bond, but i suspect fito has always known. at the root of his ignorance lies the understanding that it was never in jeopardy. we will never have a better friend than the friend we have in each other",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,"A veteran's best friend; I didn't want to get attached to Fito, but war sealed an unshakable bond",11/11/16

" his win is resuscitating the decades-old debate over whether the supply-side -- derided by democrats as ""trickle-down"" -- tax policy reagan championed can jump-start the listless u.s. economy. the theory: lowering taxes for businesses and wealthy individuals leaves more cash in their pockets, spurring more investment and hiring, and the faster growth generates enough new tax income to pay for the cuts. the top tax rate under reagan was slashed to 28% from 70%, and business deductions became more generous. about 16 million jobs were created during his two terms, and the economy grew as much as 7.3% in 1984. trump proposes chopping the top individual marginal rate to 33% from 40% -- as well as more modest cuts for those with low and moderate incomes -- and the corporate rate to 15% from 35%. the many small-business owners taxed at the individual rate also would pay 15%. ""that's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since ronald reagan,"" trump said in his first debate with hillary clinton. ""it's going to be a beautiful thing to watch."" clinton scoffed, saying such cuts simply benefit the rich. ""i call it trumped-up trickle-down because that's exactly what it would be. that is not how we grow the economy."" or is it? absolutely, says ike brannon, senior visiting fellow at the cato institute and economic adviser for sen. john mccain, r-ariz., during his 2008 presidential run. ""if you make it cheaper to invest, ultimately, companies are going to grow and hire more people,"" he says. nonsense, says jared bernstein, former chief economist for vice president biden and a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities. first, he says, it's not clear that tax cuts are what juiced the economy in the 1980s, noting reagan spearheaded massive increases in defense spending -- from $325 billion in 1980 to as much $456 billion in 1987 -- that rippled across the economy. the lower taxes and higher military spending nearly tripled the national debt to $2.8 trillion by the time reagan left office, stoking inflation fears that contributed to the recession under president george h.w. bush in 1990-91. president  clinton ""significantly raised taxes and had bigger job gains than reagan,"" bernstein says. about 22 million jobs were created in the eight years clinton was in office, and the economy grew an average 3.8% a year, helped, in part, by a tech boom that turbocharged business productivity. despite tax cuts for the wealthy, the economy slipped into a deep recession in george w. bush's term. bernstein says sharp tax cuts made more sense in the reagan era. the 70% top personal tax rate was far higher than the current 40%, so the massive reduction could have unleashed much more pent-up demand for investment than trump's plan would. besides, while interest rates are near record lows and many companies are awash in cash, it's not as if they don't have easy access to funds for capital spending, bernstein says. yet, he says, many have chosen to buy back stock and fatten dividends. mark zandi, chief economist of moody's analytics, says tax cuts do lead to stronger investment and job growth, but those benefits ""are generally overstated",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Can Trump make 'trickle-down' economics work?; Reagan slashed taxes and increased defense spending, but Clinton created more jobs",11/14/16

" in 1788, the founders wanted a safeguard against a process that was truly democratic. it was surmised that the voters could not be completely trusted to choose men in agreement with the educated, white, upper class who held the power. in the original constitution, senators were chosen by the state legislators. in 1913, the 17th amendment was ratified, which called for direct election of senators. this came as a result of the progressive movement that worked for the reformation of the government to better serve the people. if this recent election had gone the other way, there is no doubt in my mind that trump supporters would be calling for another amendment. they would see it as part of the forgotten man's inability to alter the direction of our government. the fact that hillary clinton won the majority of votes but lost the election is little noted. half of our nation voted for one candidate and the other half for the other. but one got the majority. times have changed. women vote; african americans vote; native americans vote. all who register can vote. let's vote directly for our president. eliminate the electoral college. susan little chapel hill, n.c. facebook the founding fathers had it right. when there were just 13 colonies, a popular vote would have let just a couple states like virginia and massachusetts decide who the president would be. all the other states would be out of luck! the electoral college tries to even the field by requiring contenders to consider more states to get elected. otherwise california, florida and new york would have a huge sway on the result. no, thanks. the whiners need to put on their big-boy pants, move on and respect the vote. if not, you are free to move about the cabin on your way to a new home country. i don't recommend iran or north korea, though, just saying. dave tomasso twitter we asked our followers their thoughts on the electoral college and whether we should keep or eliminate. the electoral college is a quirk of the u.s. government design. well intentioned but imperfect. replacing it will create new problems. @nathan_sloan the democratic party needs new progressive leadership to reflect a changing electorate. the electoral college loss is an excuse. @jeffostach of course we should keep the electoral college. its purpose is to give people of every state a proportional representation during the elections. @valentinesday97 we need to dump the electoral college vote. voters in the west coast don't count at all! the popular vote is the only way to go",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,Electoral College looks to silence certain groups,11/14/16

"s. legally. now, immigration experts are trying to figure out exactly how those policies will work in a trump administration. and so far, it looks like he will be able to follow through on many of his pledges -- with or without help from congress. ""generally speaking, any president has wide discretion when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws because immigration touches on national sovereignty,"" said stephen yale-loehr, a professor at cornell law school and author of a 21-volume treatise, immigration law and procedure. more deportations the first, and possibly easiest, change trump can make is redirecting the department of homeland security to ramp up deportations. at the beginning of the campaign, trump said all 11million undocumented immigrants in the country must go. in the closing months, he talked more about deporting immigrants with criminal records -- ""bad hombres"" -- and opened the possibility of finding a way for some to remain in the country. in an interview that aired sunday on cbs' 60 minutes, trump said he plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants. trump said he would emphasize criminals before deciding about law-abiding families legally in the country. trump would need congressional approval to hire more border patrol agents to monitor the frontier and immigration and customs enforcement agents to round up immigrants living in the interior of the country. trump doesn't need any new money to change the focus of the immigration agents who are already in place, said ali noorani, executive director of the national immigration forum, an immigrant advocacy group. ""if the department of homeland security secretary green lights, simply in tone, the ramping up of enforcement actions, that is a system that can wreak havoc very, very quickly,"" he said. deportation protections trump could unilaterally revoke the deportation protections president obama created under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca. more than 840,000 young undocumented immigrants have been approved for that program, which protects them from deportation for two-year periods and grants them work permits. stephen legomsky, professor emeritus at washington university school of law in st. louis and a former chief counsel at u.s. citizenship and immigration services, said trump could revoke every single daca case very simply. the program was created by an executive memorandum by obama's secretary of homeland security, and president-elect trump's secretary could simply rescind that memo or issue a new one. it would be more complicated to revoke their work permits. under u.s. law, homeland security must provide written notice that it plans to revoke the permits and recipients have 15 days to respond -- but don't have a right to a court hearing to fight the revocation. legomsky questioned whether trump would then move to deport all those daca recipients. since trump won't be able to quickly deport all of the nation's undocumented immigrants, legomsky said daca recipients are the least likely targets since they have clean criminal records, they've been working or going to school and they've already been vetted by the federal government. ""as a practical matter, it seems like these folks would be the lowest priority of all,"" he said. refugee programs a president has very broad, unilateral discretion to determine which refugees -- those fleeing war and other threats to their safety -- are admitted into the country. the number of refugees accepted by the u.s. each year is set exclusively by the president. president obama has increased the number of refugees from 70,000 in 2015 to 110,000 in 2017. trump repeatedly bashed that decision, saying refugees from countries like syria were threats to national security because they had not been properly vetted and could include terrorists. the state department says syrian refugees undergo the strictest background checks. as president, trump could drop the total number of refugees to zero. ""congress can ask questions and object to things, but ultimately it's up to the president,"" legomsky said. the muslim ban presidents have the power to bar access to the u.s. to specific immigrants or entire classes of immigrants. that power is laid out in the immigration and nationality act, which allows a president to block would-be immigrants if they are deemed ""detrimental to the interests of the united states."" yale-loehr said that provision has been used sporadically over the decades to bar dictators, military strongmen and others who worked to undermine democracy in countries like north korea, venezuela, south sudan and libya. but he said it's never been used in the way or the extent proposed by trump, who had initially called for a temporary ban on all immigrants from all muslim countries. such a proposal would have likely faced a slew of lawsuits from groups claiming it violates first amendment protections for freedom of religion. in recent months, trump altered the description of his ban, saying he would target immigrants from ""terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur."" legomsky said if trump worded such a proclamation based on terrorism grounds and not on religious grounds, ""then i'm sure that order would hold up in court."" the border wall extending the 650 miles of wall or fencing that currently exist would require congressional approval because of the billions of dollars that the project would cost. trump told 60 minutes that in ""certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,"" but ""there could be some fencing."" congress may need to create a legal mechanism to withhold remittances that mexicans in the u.s. send back to their families in mexico, a revenue stream that trump says would help pay for construction of the wall. so far, it looks like there's interest on capitol hill. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., said on wednesday that border security ""is something i think ought to be high on the list."" and house speaker paul ryan, r-wis",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"Trump to have broad power for immigration crackdown; For much of his plan, he won't need Congress",11/14/16
" trump also considered campaign ceo stephen  bannon for the slot but announced that the former breitbart news executive would serve as chief strategist and senior counselor for the administration that takes office in little more than two months. ""i am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,"" trump said in a statement. ""steve and reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. now i will have them both with me in the white house as we work to make america great again."" in thanking trump for the appointment, priebus said he would strive to ""create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace obamacare and destroy radical islamic terrorism."" bannon, who joined trump's team in august, said that ""we had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. we will have that same partnership in working to help president-elect trump achieve his agenda."" priebus, a lawyer and political operative who became republican party chairman in 2011, developed the get-out-the-vote operation that trump's campaign rode to a come-from-behind victory over democratic opponent hillary clinton. while critical of some of trump's comments at times, priebus became one of the gop establishment's most vocal proponents of trump after the new york businessman won the party nomination. the new white house chief of staff is also a close ally of a frequent trump critic, house speaker paul ryan. as a news executive, bannon helped turned breitbart into a leading voice of conservatism and a champion of trump's candidacy. but ryan has been one of the news site's top targets. beyond personnel announcements, the president-elect began sketching out policy priorities this weekend and appeared to temper some of his campaign rhetoric. his proposed wall along the u.s.-mexican border may include some fencing instead, trump said, and his initial deportation plan will focus on ""criminals"" who are in the country illegally. in ""certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,"" but ""there could be some fencing,"" trump said in an interview with cbs' sunday newsmagazine 60 minutes. while pledging more deportations, trump said he would emphasize criminals before deciding what to do about law-abiding families who are in the country illegally. ""what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,"" trump told cbs, later adding: ""after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people."" trump put the number of deportable criminals at 2 million to 3 million, but immigration experts say it is much lower. in addition to the 60 minutes interview, the president-elect and aides holed up high in trump tower throughout the weekend as they pursued staffing decisions and policy planning. since his election win over clinton on tuesday night, trump has granted a couple of select interviews, spoken with republican officials and foreign leaders -- and tweeted, including more pot shots at his media coverage. ""wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'trump phenomena,'"" trump tweeted early sunday. trump pledged to be ""very restrained"" with social media during his presidency, but told 60 minutes that ""the fact that i have such power in terms of numbers with facebook, twitter, instagram, et cetera, i think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than i spent. and i won."" social media, trump said, ""has more power than the money they spent, and i think maybe to a certain extent, i proved that."" trump also seemed to extend olive branches to his critics over the weekend, including possible compromises on his plan to repeal president obama's health care law. trump spoke in terms of keeping provisions that forbid insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. trump has also said his priorities include a program of road-and-bridge projects (""infrastructure""), deregulation of financial institutions, and beefing up the border against drugs and illegal immigration. while the trump campaign has provided little information, foreign governments have confirmed that their leaders spoke with the president-elect. the government of france, for example, said president franois hollande spoke with trump for about 10 minutes friday about terrorism and syria. a japanese official said prime minister shinzo abe will be in new york on thursday to meet with the incoming u.s. president. as trump and his team huddled upstairs in his manhattan tower, thousands of demonstrators massed outside on fifth avenue throughout the weekend, protesting what they called his racist and sexist behavior throughout the campaign",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"Trump turns to GOP allies; He appoints loyalists to chief of staff, chief strategist positions",11/14/16
" but his greater impact, at least in the short run, could come by filling vacancies and replacing retiring judges on federal appeals courts that hear 400 times as many cases. it has taken president obama nearly eight years to liberalize a majority of those courts. at the end of george w. bush's presidency, 10 of the 13 circuit courts had a majority of judges nominated by republican presidents. today, nine of them have a majority of democratic presidents' nominees. but not for long: trump is likely to reverse that advantage in just one term, establishing republican control over nine appeals courts and leaving three others deadlocked, based on current retirement trends. only the special appeals court created in 1982 to hear patent and trademark cases would retain a majority of democratic appointees. ""he will quickly have an opportunity to tip the balance back to ultra-conservative control over a majority of the circuits,"" says nan aron, president of the liberal alliance for justice. ""there will be a huge ideological shift in these influential courts around the country."" the projected reversal is crucial, because while the supreme court hears only about 75 cases each term, the appeals courts hear some 30,000. only the most significant or divisive cases find their way to the high court, which has slashed its caseload in recent decades. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, in particular, plays a critical role in determining the legality of administration policies and regulations. that court currently is deciding whether to allow obama's clean air regulations, which would require some coal-fired plants to shut down or invest in natural gas, wind or solar power. so important is that court to a president's priorities that senate democrats changed the rules in 2013 to prevent republicans from being able to block lower court confirmations with filibusters. that cleared the way for obama to fill three vacancies and install a majority of democratic president nominees. the court is the most frequent stepping-stone to the supreme court. federal appeals courts have played a particularly crucial role since february, when justice antonin scalia's death left the supreme court with only eight members. republicans' refusal to confirm obama's nominee -- merrick garland, the chief judge of the d.c. circuit court -- forced the justices to leave lower court rulings on obama's immigration plan and the power of labor unions intact following 4-4 votes. garland's nomination has been pending for eight months, almost twice as long as the previous record. but senate republicans and democrats view the appeals courts as so important that confirmation battles have stretched longer than two years and led some nominees to withdraw from consideration. ""most of the fighting over nominations will be over those very circuit courts,"" says curt levey, a conservative attorney with freedomworks and the committee for justice. under trump, he says, ""groups on the right will be agitating both for speed and for filling them with the right constitutionalist, textualist judges."" judges named by obama to federal appellate and district courts overseeing north carolina, texas, michigan and wisconsin voted during the recent political campaign season against restrictions on voting imposed by republican legislatures. in states where obama's judges had less influence, such as ohio and virginia, courts left restrictions on voting in place. looking ahead, trump's appeals court judges could play major roles in cases testing the ability of religious objectors to sidestep government regulations, as well as cases involving the rights of criminal defendants. the supreme court's decision in june striking down abortion restrictions in texas still leaves appeals courts with the job of deciding which types of limits to permit. another major impact obama has had on lower federal courts could be tested under trump: more women and minorities. about 43% of obama's nominees have been women and 36% minorities, surpassing  records under bill clinton",NEWS; Pg. 2A,USA TODAY,U.S. courts to shift right under Trump; Appeals judges have key roles in judiciary,11/14/16
" four out of five white evangelicals voted for the republican nominee, according to exit polls. how did people of faith reconcile the teaching of christ with the tough rhetoric of the reality star and real estate mogul? for many, it came down to a few major issues, such as abortion and supreme court appointments. they also were swayed by party loyalty and fear of a government under hillary clinton. and something more basic: trump courted them. ""there was only one candidate in this race, one major candidate, who actually asked for the votes of white evangelicals, and that was donald trump,"" said michael  wear, a faith adviser to president obama. ""white evangelicals, with some merit, feel embattled and isolated. he said, 'i'm the only one who can save you, i'm the one who hears you.' and hillary doesn't even enter into this conversation."" in 2000 and 2004, democrats didn't like the religious right and didn't work with them, wear said. ""in 2006, the democratic party made an intentional decision to invest resources into reaching evangelicals explicitly, and it paid off. they let go of that in this election cycle."" anglican priest thomas mckenzie, who is the pastor of church of the redeemer in nashville thinks some evangelical christians who picked trump for president despite his moral failings had their eyes on the supreme court. mckenzie, who had publicly opposed trump in favor of any other candidate, said christians whose primary concerns are stopping abortions, protecting religious freedom and preserving traditional views on gay and transgender issues want a conservative high court. so they picked the candidate most likely to deliver that outcome. ""i had several conversations with people who said, 'i'm not voting for donald trump; i'm voting for a conservative supreme court,'"" mckenzie said. but the christian witness is not aided by political power, mckenzie argued. in the case of trump, mckenzie is concerned his administration won't take care of the poor and the marginalized. the church is called to do it, and mckenzie hopes it steps up, especially if the next president doesn't. ""jesus said, 'my kingdom is not of this world.' and the problem that i think that we should've remembered from the 1980s is that when we marry christianity with power, it goes well for the powerful, but it doesn't go well for christianity,"" mckenzie said. the moral majority, led by baptist minister jerry falwell, grew to 4million members in the 1980s and became one of the nation's largest lobbying groups. it clearly helped that he wasn't hillary clinton. by sept. 23, 35% of white evangelicals and 30% of catholics supported trump because ""he is not clinton,"" according to pew research center. they also liked that he was an outsider who would bring change. contributing: holly meyer and natalie alund, the tennessean; beth walton, asheville, (n.c.) citizen-times; and jim smilie, the (alexandria, la",NEWS; Pg. 8A,USA TODAY,"What Trump vote means for evangelicals; President-elect won high percentage of their vote, despite his personal history.

" a wave of populism already has spread to eastern europe, where countries that include croatia, hungary, poland and slovenia have rightist  governments. farther west, austria next month could elect europe's first far-right head of state since world war ii. norbert hofer of the freedom party narrowly lost a race for the largely ceremonial post in april, but a new election was ordered because of alleged irregularities in counting mailed ballots. france, germany and the netherlands, which hold general elections in 2017, also have seen a u.s.-style shift in support from mainstream parties to anti-establishment nationalists. the trend comes amid growing anxiety over weak job prospects tied to globalization, as well as a migrant crisis seen as a threat to security and a drain on social welfare benefits. many europeans blame the problems on decades of membership in the european union, which they feel is oblivious to their concerns about the free flow of labor and migration within the 28-nation bloc. ""people are sick and tired of politicians who refused to listen to their worries about rising immigration, the loss of law and order, taxes being spent abroad while domestic needs are rising, trade agreements that harm employment at home,"" said geert wilders, a dutch lawmaker and leader of the netherlands' far-right party for freedom. ""we are witnessing a patriotic spring, in america as well as in europe,"" he told usa today. ""our people have the same worries as the american people. the trump victory proves that change is possible."" wouter dol of the netherlands institute for multiparty democracy, a group that helps young democracies organize elections, said wilders paints himself as a political outsider like trump despite being a seasoned politician with more than a decade of lawmaking experience. netherlands wilders is expected to mount a serious challenge to prime minister mark rutte's conservative-liberal people's party for freedom and democracy in march elections. ""the traditional parties have not been sensing the temperature of society very well,"" said dol. trump's backers identify with his vow to reject the political elite and take back control of american institutions and policy that he claims have been undermined by years of corrupt and inefficient government. ""the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" trump declared in his victory speech early wednesday. ""this is part of a worldwide phenomenon. it's in the u.s., europe, but also in russia, turkey, china,"" said michael wohlgemuth, director of the berlin office of open europe, a research organization. ""there's pretty much a similar pattern everywhere you look, and a lot of it is about identity politics,"" he added. france one of those shocks could come in france next spring. polls in french media show marine le pen, leader of the far-right national front, will comfortably sail into the second round of a presidential election for the first time, although she might not emerge the ultimate winner. ""nothing is immutable,"" le pen said after trump's win. her father, party founder jean-marie le pen, said on twitter: ""today, the united states, tomorrow france."" approval ratings for france's current president, socialist franois hollande, are abysmal in the wake of a string of terror attacks. germany in germany, where chancellor angela merkel must call an election before october, wohlgemuth from open europe said that despite recent gains in state and local elections by the right-wing and anti-eu alternative fí_r deutschland party (afd), germans are unlikely to vote to ""pull up the draw-bridge"" next year.

" marco rubio. instead, party leaders and activists were left forlornly looking ahead to key elections in 2018 (u.s. senator, governor, the state legislature) and another crack at the white house in 2020. that pivot began friday with the announcement by florida democratic party chairwoman allison tant that she would not seek re-election in january. ""i will use the remainder of my term to ensure that the next chair is able to hit the ground running on day one with as smooth of a transition as possible,"" she wrote in a letter to democratic executive committee. democrats in the nation's most important swing state have a lot to chew over. trump won the state by nearly 120,000 votes tuesday and clinton won only nine of florida's 67 counties: alachua, broward, gadsden, hillsborough, leon, miami-dade, orange osceola and palm beach. and rubio coasted to a second term over democratic congressman patrick murphy. the first task at hand is reclaiming the governor's mansion in 2018, which democrats haven't won since lawton chiles captured it in 1994. several names have been mentioned, including u.s. rep gwen graham, d-tallahassee; tallahassee mayor andrew gillum; and tampa mayor bob buckhorn. agriculture commissioner adam putnam is considered the early gop front-runner though incoming florida house speaker richard corcoran has also hinted at a run for governor. equally important for democrats is protecting bill nelson's senate seat. he is the only statewide elected democrat in florida. nelson is expected to face stiff competition from gop gov. rick scott. in addition, all 120 seats will be up in the state house as well as some state senate seats because of recently redrawn districts. then, of course, the presidential election looms again four years from now. florida democrats say they must connect better with working class voters whose angst about the economy helped propel trump to victory. ""we have to let them know that they're included in our vision for the future,"" said gillum, who was considered as clinton's running mate. ""we should let people know we're in tune and that we have plans to make their lives a little easier, rather than the impression that we're aloof and disconnected."" it didn't help that the clinton campaign brought in out-of-state consultants who didn't know the local terrain, said al lawson, a tallahassee democrat who won a congressional seat tuesday. ""i've seen people from all over the place -- california, new york -- and we have all these people here who are just as good but they're not hired,"" lawson said. ""and those (local) people resent that."" some activists expressed frustration that the state party under tant often ignored areas of the state that were not democratic strongholds. jeffrey kushner, former democratic chairman in staunchly republican lee county, said a little more money would make a difference. southwest florida is not turning democratic any time soon but having more resources would help blunt the region's  republican advantage and aid statewide democratic candidates. trump won lee county 59%-38% over clinton. in 2012, romney's margin of victory was 4 percentage points smaller -- 58%-41% -- which allowed obama to win florida in whisker-thin fashion by dominating in bluer parts of the state. ""right after an election like this where we got trounced, you're going to see a lot of democrats abandon the local party for a while and that's going to make it even more difficult at the local level for democrats to pay the rent, have functions, discuss issues, things like that,"" kushner said. ""if the state party would help out a little, it would make it easier. you could get working on the grass-roots again which is what's going to have to happen."" one of the few wins for florida democrats on election day was the congressional campaign for former  governor charlie crist, who ousted  republican incumbent david jolly in the st. petersburg area. crist's top campaign adviser, tallahassee-based strategist kevin cate, said the wave of sentiment that helped launch trump's victory could be followed by a competing wave in 2018. he pointed to 2008 when obama's presidential win was followed two years later by the tea party movement that helped elect republican newcomers in florida like scott. like gillum, cate said clinton's loss is a chance to learn why the united states' frustrated middle class was not listening to her message.

""this is an area where i believe we must proceed very carefully, though,"" said zuckerberg, who reasserted that ""more than 99% of what people see is authentic."" zuckerberg provided no specifics about how facebook's news feed might be changed, cautioning that ""this work often takes longer than we'd like in order to confirm changes we make won't introduce unintended side effects or bias into the system."" he encouraged facebook's millions of worldwide users to follow updates online. the latest statements responded to growing criticism of facebook's ascendant power to sway public opinion. he initially dismissed suggestions that fake stories -- such as ones that stated pope francis had supported donald trump -- played no a role in the republican presidential nominee's victory over democrat hillary clinton. ""to think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,"" zuckerberg said thursday at the techonomy conference in half moon bay, calif. zuckerberg's combined comments on the issue back-to-back statements came as trump's win prompted silicon valley soul searching, with some wondering whether tools created in u.s. tech world's capital might have run amok. social media has increasingly become a go-to news source. nearly half of americans get their news from facebook, according to the pew research center. in contrast, just two in 10 u.s. adults get news from print newspapers. through this all, facebook has resisted calls that it's become a de facto news publisher, exercising editorial judgment with the power to sway the minds of billions, and instead reiterated that it's simply a technology platform. zuckerberg reiterated that stance again, saying ""i believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of the truth ourselves,"" he wrote. ""identifying the 'truth' is complicated. while some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted,"" zuckerberg wrote. even more facebook news stories ""express an opinion that many will disagree with"" and incorrectly flag them as inaccurate, he added. ""i am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but i believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of the truth ourselves,"" zuckerberg wrote. but the growing news source is also experiencing growing pains. while fake news has posed a longstanding challenge for facebook, the problem appeared to accelerate during the election. president obama addressed the issue during a pre-election michigan rally for clinton last week. ""and people, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's on facebook and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people start believing it. and it creates this dust cloud of nonsense,"" obama said.

" it's an institutional breakdown in the ability to do the basic job. big banks should have hedged their bets against the subprime meltdown. similarly, the media is supposed to keep enough of an open mind to the factors at hand to at least provide for the possibility of alternative outcomes. with both the housing bubble and the 2016 election, more caution on the part of the experts might have led to different tactics and strategies that might have altered history's course. this was not simple human error -- ""dewey defeats truman"" -- which might have been bad enough. for both the media and the financial industry, the failure to maintain objectivity came, in large part, from becoming uniquely vested in one outcome. the banking industry saw its incentives in rising house prices, and became blind, willfully so, to the possibility of their decline. the media ideologically aligned itself not just against donald trump but with the demographic groups that made up its audience. it found itself telling the stories its audience wanted to hear, a problem compounded by the fact that these were the stories the people in the media most wanted to hear. the media surely sees its culpability as qualitatively different from the banking industry's villainy. bankers were literally corrupt, actually knowing the housing bubble would collapse and yet, nevertheless, artificially holding it up. and yet, in fact, most of the fault in the banking industry -- which is why there have been few prosecutions -- fell somewhere on the scale between willful and passive ignorance, a place most media people found themselves in this election. for one thing, it would have been quite a difficult bind for any serious or rising journalist in a national news organization to have actually been a trump supporter -- as odd a position as a trader insisting at the height of the market on a house market crash. trump, after all, had been declared, by almost every news organization, ""unsuitable."" in fact, to align with trump supporters was to align with an ethos that might well have come perilously close to crossing the hr rules in most news organizations. to support trump was to support racism and sexism. most people in most newsrooms would likely have believed that. perhaps all the millennials in the newsrooms -- their lack of experience and commensurate low paychecks making them the fastest-rising newsroom demographic -- believed that. yes, but what is a journalist witnessing the rise of fascism to do? that has been the end-of-the-world newsroom view. trump is post-truth. journalists are fighters for truth. in this instance, truth became something like a financial derivative -- a construct based on the special knowingness of insiders and self-serving math. jill abramson, the former editor of the new york times and now a freelance advocate for good journalism, took to twitter to excuse her former employer. ""great institution falsely blamed for 'getting it wrong.' job of @nytimes is to inform and hold power accountable. did both magnificently."" in fact, while those might be nice results, the actual job is to be accurate. getting it wrong ought to be as dismal a result as when a bank loses money, with someone called on the carpet. when structural flaws in method and in intelligence make it increasingly difficult (if not impossible) to get it right, that's an institutional crisis -- a kind of bankruptcy. this is not a question of condoning or supporting donald trump -- and here, arguably, the media surely contributed to creating the trump bubble, which it bet would burst -- but an issue of being able to understand the ways in which he might be a credible candidate. in this, most media organizations applied vast research and data capabilities to assessing that the likelihood of his candidacy succeeding was nigh impossible. the new york times, the washington post, the huffington post, cnn, even buzzfeed are perhaps too big to fail -- at least in a journalistic, if not financial, sense. no one is going to hold them accountable for painting a picture of reality that was not real, indeed for trying to use their influence to bend reality. no one need take responsibility. leaders at the times and cnn, in fact, issued rousing encomiums to the greatness of their election coverage and the accomplishments of their staffs. bad calls, even gross misunderstandings of the fundamental currents of the time, being merely yesterday's news and hence easily forgotten. in a time of deep media unpopularity, it would surely have been wiser and more honorable for these leaders to have fallen on their swords. already there is a circling of the wagons with regard to what trump will do to the media. the media, as thin-skinned and defensive as any political candidate -- quite trump-like in fact -- will likely go from making any effort to right itself, an introspective role it has never been comfortable in, to defending its virtues",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Media has itself to blame for such an epic election fail; Botched coverage similar to that of '07 financial meltdown,11/14/16

" he can order troops into combat. he can bomb any country he wants. he can round up illegal immigrants. he can spy on millions of people. soon all that power will be in the hands of donald trump, hardly the most sober and restrained individual ever to occupy the oval office. our checks and balances  will be more important in his administration than in any other. if trump  misbehaves, there is always the possibility he could be impeached. but let's hope it never comes to that because it would be a terrible ordeal. the courts can also provide a check,  but they seldom interfere in foreign affairs. eventually, the voters will get another say. in the short term, the most important checks are political appointees, career professionals and legislators. i was one of 122 national security experts who signed a letter opposing trump. the temptation now for me and my fellow #nevertrumpers is to want nothing to do with a candidate we considered unfit for office. the temptation for trump is to want nothing to do with people who considered him unfit. for the good of the country, i hope the two sides can come together. trump could learn something from richard nixon who, after winning the 1968 election, appointed as his national security adviser  henry kissinger, whom he barely knew and who had spent the previous decade working for his opponent, nelson rockefeller. it is vitally important that a president get a full range of views, and that he appoint people who are willing to stand up to him when he's wrong.  that is also true  for the professional government employees who stay on regardless of administration. many of them, especially in agencies such as the state department and the cia, where the general political outlook is liberal, will be tempted to quit in disgust. as a #nevertrumper i sympathize with their concerns, but i hope that they will hold their noses and continue to do their jobs as long as they are not asked to do anything unethical or illegal. and if they are asked to take such steps, their refusal to act will safeguard the rule of law. the third important check will be congress and especially the senate, which must confirm trump's top nominees. there are  51 republicans, 52 if they win a december runoff in louisiana -- not enough to stop a filibuster. if even two or three  defect, that should be enough to defeat a trump initiative or nominee. that will place huge potential power in the hands of a small number of #nevertrump republicans such as sens. lindsey graham, ben sasse and jeff flake. they should not block him indiscriminately, but they  should try to stop him if he acts recklessly. trump can be a successful president if he behaves less erratically than he did during the campaign. it will be up to those who work with him on both ends of pennsylvania avenue to save him from himself",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Fellow NeverTrumpers, let's not shun Trump",11/14/16
" start with the july day i spent in stark county, ohio -- long a bellwether in presidential elections -- while the republicans were having their convention in cleveland. at a greek restaurant in canton, i talked to an 83-year-old businessman named don leuchtag about the campaign. like a lot of the diners, he wasn't pleased that out of all the people in america, his choice had come down to hillary clinton and donald trump. don was torn. he didn't trust clinton for a minute. trump was offending a lot of people and selling a ""pipe dream"" about walling off america from immigrants and imports. i checked back with don shortly before the election to see what he had decided. he emailed me on election day. ""in the end i held my nose and voted for trump,"" he reported, because bill and hillary clinton seem to believe that the rules don't apply to them. ""i know trump is an unknown card, but maybe that's what we need,"" he added. ""we will not solve our major problems under the current people in office."" as ohio went as don leuchtag goes, i thought, so goes stark county. so it did. (trump beat clinton in the county by 17 percentage points; in 2012, president obama and mitt romney were virtually tied there.) as stark county went, so went ohio. (trump won the state by more than 8 percentage points; in 2012, obama won by 2 points.) and as ohio went, so went the nation. (no republican, trump included, has ever captured the white house without winning the buckeye state.) with the benefit of hindsight, that day in stark county provided other signals about the underlying forces driving the election. sitting at another table at the athens restaurant was a white canton police officer who was unhappy with clinton's support of the black lives matter movement, a reminder of the racial tensions never far from the surface in america. another customer, patrick rimke, 64, started our conversation by mentioning something he had read that morning on breitbart, the pro-trump website. his comment confirmed that even older voters were bypassing traditional news media in favor of partisan news sources stoking anti-establishment fervor. in fact, breitbart's chairman, stephen bannon, would soon become ceo of the trump campaign. trump was appealing to ""people who are fed up,"" said rimke. hoover factory i then headed for north canton, home to the massive brick factory where hoover vacuum cleaners used to be manufactured. hoover and later owners had shifted thousands of jobs to texas, mexico and ultimately china. the union hall across main street from the mostly vacant plant was about to close down for good. i asked one of the last people there, jean rice, who or what she blamed. ""probably nafta and bad trade deals,"" rice replied, echoing trump's message on the campaign trail. when people back home in deep-blue maryland asked how trump could possibly have won the gop nomination, and whether he had a shot in november, i'd take out my smartphone and show them a photo of the former hoover plant. sure enough, trump's improbable path to victory sliced straight through the rust belt states of pennsylvania, ohio, michigan and wisconsin and their counties flush with white, working-class voters. my final clue that an upset might be in the making came from a working-class hispanic woman i know. a few days before election day, i asked her how she planned to vote. considering trump's denigration of mexican immigrants and a latina beauty queen, i presumed she'd be firmly and enthusiastically in the clinton camp. but she said she was undecided, concerned that clinton might end up in jail if elected. her chauvinistic husband, she added, didn't think a woman should be president. and sure enough, surveys of people after they voted suggested that trump did far better than expected among hispanics, about as well as mitt romney did in 2012. anecdotal evidence? absolutely",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"How I missed the signs of a Trump win; The clues, there all along, should have made me question the polls",11/14/16
" the oscar winner grabs a wand in j.k. rowling's fantastic beasts and where to find them (in theaters nationwide friday, with preview screenings thursday night) and took his muggle self to a wildlife park in england to prepare to play a magizoologist. ""there was this anteater that had just been born, and people were trying to feed her and she kept scrunching herself into a ball. the way they would make her uncurl was to tickle her belly,"" says redmayne, 34, whose floppy-haired wizard surreptitiously transports magical animals to the usa inside a bottomless travel case. on screen, the actor copies that trick to relieve an adorable, kleptomaniac creature called the niffler of its horde of pocketed gems in fantastic beasts, a harry potter spinoff that meets newt scamander as he disembarks from a ship in new york city, 70 years before potter's story starts. let's start with the basics: in fantastic beasts, set in america circa 1926, the non-magical sort are called no-majs instead of muggles, and this era is plagued not by voldemort but by the dark wizard gellert grindelwald, who has  vanished after terrorizing half of europe. set in a period of prohibition, with fascism growing abroad, there's a power struggle going on inside the big apple, with a witch-hunting sect known as the second salemers threatening security for a magical community bent on keeping wizarding under a cloak of secrecy. redmayne was attracted to how rowling set the tale amid real-world events. ""what i loved about the potter films was the idea that you could be living coinciding with this whole other thing going on,"" says the actor, whose wizard is joined by brand-new sidekicks: an american witch named tina goldstein (katherine waterston), who was recently sidelined from her job as an auror, and jacob kowalski (dan fogler), a no-maj baker who stumbles into newt's frantic search for his beloved, erratic creatures. with rowling on board as screenwriter, the new film is the author's way into ""telling a much bigger story of an epic battle of good vs. evil and of sort of segregation and repression and this big idea that this grindelwald character believes in a superior race, and that wizards should be ruling over the world,"" redmayne says. the seed of fantastic beasts, as fans know, comes not from best-selling novels but from one of harry potter's textbooks (which bears same title as the new film), published as a supplemental one-off by scholastic in 2001. with less source material to draw from,  ""you don't have the security of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies,"" allows david heyman, who produced all eight potter films, which have grossed more than $7.7 billion worldwide. ""but with that comes a certain freedom because you don't have to deal with people's expectations."" and thanks to fresh faces and new creatures including a giant thunderbird (named frank) and a clingy, lock-picking tree-creature called a bowtruckle, ""it's a world anyone can dive into,"" the producer says. ""you don't have to have seen a harry potter film to enjoy this or read a harry potter book. i think it stands on its own. but if you have, you have a slightly different experience informed by that."" telling a darker tale harry potter and the deathly hallows: part 2  bid farewell to potterheads in 2011, but rowling never formally closed hogwarts' doors, thanks to new stories released via the author's ever-expanding pottermore website, her critically acclaimed west end play, harry potter and the cursed child (which flings the potter cast 19 years forward and was printed as a script-book in august), and casual character reveals, including dumbledore's sexuality (he was gay). the actor met the famous author just before he started filming. ""she was working on the play whilst writing the second fantastic beasts film, (and) she would come in with nuggets of information"" for the cast, says redmayne, marveling at her full plate. ""and you're like, 'i don't know how you compartmentalize.' ... it's kind of extraordinary."" in fantastic beasts, rowling goes even darker, haunting new york with a malevolent force and pitting the director of magical security, percival graves (colin farrell), against newt. ""it's a process of finding the right tone,"" says director david yates, who helmed the last four harry potter films. fantastic beasts is ""set in the world of grown-ups, and the themes are quite grown-up; inevitably it's a little bit darker.""  he notes that rowling has ""never been afraid in the potter books to look at things like death and bereavement or the darker side of humanity."" here's the 411 on newt scamander: the mop-haired friend to the gnarliest of beasts hails from a serious british wizarding family (in the book, his mother is a hippogriff breeder). ""his brother is quite an influential and strong auror -- much more part of the establishment, whereas newt is absolutely not that,"" redmayne says. ""he's his own person, and he doesn't work well with rules or regulations."" for reasons unknown, newt lives a life of solitude with his coterie of beasts -- whom he spends most of the film chasing down after they flee his cavernous case. the actor had just portrayed two real people back to back when he took the role: stephen hawking in the theory of everything, which won him an oscar in 2015, and transgender artist lili elbe in the danish girl, which earned him another oscar nomination. ""i was weirdly relieved, having played two real people most recently, actually to be playing someone that was fictional and that didn't come necessarily burdened with people's expectations of who that person should be,"" he says. (fun fact: roughly 15 years ago, while at school, redmayne answered a harry potter casting call  for the role of tom riddle. he received no call back. ""i think i got about three lines into my audition, and it was with the assistant to the assistant,"" he laughs.) that 'franchise' word in a world of hollywood braggadocio, the gracious brit has remained remarkably unchanged since his pre-oscar days. over a long lunch, he's chatty and inquisitive about other professions, sharing anecdotes about life as a father (he and his wife, hannah bagshawe, welcomed a baby girl named iris in june) and comparing notes on cilantro (he's a fan). though thanks to infant-induced four-hour sleep stretches, ""i'm not quite sure what's coming out of my mouth,"" he says. after years of shooting films back to back, redmayne describes taking what americans would call an extended ""babymoon."" ""before iris was born, we did some dream things; we traveled around japan and we went to paris for a month. basically, since we've been together, it's been rigorous. it felt like almost like a sabbatical. it was so much fun."" there's  one word he still struggles with: ""franchise."" even on a question regarding the financial stability that comes with a series (redmayne is signed on to at least three of what rowling recently revealed are five planned fantastic beasts films), the actor steers focus back on the present. ""i just hope that people enjoy this film first off. what i loved about the script was it was its own thing. it stood alone. ...  it has its own wholeness to it."" but analysts expect these beasts to rise again, predicting a $75 million to $100 million haul in the film's first weekend. ""how do you follow harry potter? you make an amazing movie, and with social media buzz so strong, the film looks like it could be one of the biggest  of the year,"" says paul dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comscore. a second script is  in the works, and potter diehards know somewhere in this new world awaits an epic battle, given that dumbledore defeated grindelwald in a duel in 1945.

" the orson welles drama turns 75 this year, continues to be hailed by critics as the greatest movie ever made and gets a special screening sunday at los angeles' american film institute festival (plus a new blu-ray/dvd edition out tuesday). that said, it doesn't have anywhere near the mainstream reputation of beloved films such as star wars, the godfather, casablanca, gone with the wind or the wizard of oz -- all movies on the afi's list of the best 100 american films of all time, which kane happens to top. kane, which stars welles as hearst-inspired media mogul charles foster kane, was a personal favorite of famed critics pauline kael and roger ebert, as well as president-elect donald trump. but for younger generations, citizen kane is a masterpiece they've likely never seen because it doesn't play every holiday like it's a wonderful life. so is it all that? let's say it lives up to its 100% positive rotten tomatoes score. here are five ways citizen kane earns its ""greatest ever"" billing: 1 welles broke the mold with his filmmaking. non-linear storytelling is commonplace now but wasn't commonplace in hollywood circa 1941. citizen kane opens at kane's super-palatial estate as he's on his deathbed, uttering his mysterious final word: ""rosebud."" from there, the story is told in flashbacks as an investigative reporter (william alland) interviews former colleagues, loved ones and other unreliable narrators to piece together the puzzle of kane's life. 2 the hollywood icon was also excellent in front of the camera. in addition to directing kane when he was just 25, the prodigious welles does a terrific job of inhabiting the character from his mid-20s to his death, selling the newspaper magnate's rise and fall. there's no cgi here: it's all great makeup work and a master thespian. (welles wasn't too shabby on a typewriter, either. he won his lone academy award for the kane screenplay.) 3 kane set a precedent for important films about mass media. unlike all the president's men or spotlight, citizen kane takes a negative view of a high-profile newspaperman. kane engages in yellow journalism to sway public opinion on the spanish-american war and take aim at his enemies. but a lack of journalistic integrity  does considerable damage to his close relationships. 4 the movie is still  culturally relevant. ""if i hadn't been very rich, i might have been a really great man,"" kane says, and the story of a rich icon and political contender using media to further his own power is all too topical after the recent presidential election. he has dreams of becoming president, though they're dashed after a scandal deep-sixes his clear path to a gubernatorial victory. 5 it has a twist ending before they were cool. decades before haley joel osment saw dead people and darth vader revealed his parentage to luke skywalker, citizen kane pulled off the first huge cinematic swerve",LIFE; Pg. 3D,USA TODAY,'Citizen Kane' just as important today; 5 reasons why Orson Welles' master- piece is the best movie you may have never seen,11/14/16

""they all presumed ratings would go down because the trump factor added so much to the race,"" says chris ariens, editor of tvnewser. but then tuesday happened. trump defied most polls and emerged victorious, leaving tv networks to quickly reconsider coverage plans and story ideas.

""you've got a more dynamic transition in place,"" says chris isham, cbs news' washington bureau chief. ""he's not a predictable republican, not in the way of previous administrations."" gauging trump's comfort level with the press, already underway, has been as challenging as pinning down his stance on issues. reporters who have known him for years speak of his accessibility and willingness to banter. yet he's also sought political advantage in bashing the mainstream media.

" in the week  i've had to test daydream view, i not only craved more vr content, but wished more of the daydream experiences i tried blew me away. only a select few apps were made available by google for this review. still, the beauty and promise of all virtual reality is that it places you somewhere that would be difficult if not near impossible for most of us to experience. and as a mobile vr solution along the lines of samsung's gear vr, daydream does give  a hint of that promise. i particularly enjoyed poking around youtube vr. in one video, i landed in the arctic, within virtual spitting distance of a polar bear and cub. in another, i got to see what it was like in the depths of the isle of jaws, a hotbed for great white sharks. it was also fun watching movie trailers on the virtual gigantic screen theater inside google play, though i'm not convinced i'd commit hours of wearing daydream to take in an entire film. but i'm getting ahead of myself. what you need. for now, you'll need to buy one of the two recently launched google smartphones, the pixel or the pixel xl, to experience daydream, since these are the only compatible phones on the market. more capable android handsets are on the way, and so are more capable daydream-ready apps. google expects daydream phones to arrive in the coming months from samsung, htc, zte, xiaomi, alcatel, asus, lg, motorola, and htc. huawei's recently announced  mate 9 pro also will work with daydream. in the slowly evolving consumer ecosystem for virtual reality, you can lump daydream in with the $99.99 oculus-powered samsung gear vr. gear vr also  works only with a limited set of smartphones. daydream is a step up in price and class compared with the $15 (on up) google cardboard virtual-reality viewers that google and its partners make available. and like gear vr, it is way cheaper and accessible, albeit less compelling, than the pricey oculus rift or htv vive machines that need to be tethered to powerful computers, or the playstation vr system that sony sells, which connects to playstation game consoles. daydream vs. gear vr. daydream is made of a light, breathable fabric and  is more compact and comfortable to wear than the hard-plastic gear vr, which at times felt heavy on the bridge of my nose. both headsets can be worn over eyeglasses. you start out by placing the pixel on a tray and closing a latch that is secured by pulling an elastic loop over a nub. the outer edge of your phone remains exposed so that you can plug in headphones. ensure a tight fit by adjusting a strap. i found that the headset sometimes slid down slightly. that's important not only for comfort but for a proper focus. daydream lacks a gear vr-style focus wheel, which means the sharpness of the images correlates to how the thing sits  on your face. another big difference: google's set comes with a separate wireless oblong controller, which has a clickable touchpad and a few buttons for controlling apps, volume and the action in whatever vr experience you're involved in. on gear vr, there's a built-in touchpad along the right temple, so this is a big advantage for google. you can stow the controller inside daydream when you're not using the headset; it's kept in place by an elastic band, minimizing the chance  you'll misplace it. the daydream controller has a usb-c charging port that is compatible with the cable that comes with the pixel. according to  google, the battery will last about 12 hours of active use or more than a day in standby mode. bring on the content. in the end, of course, daydream will live or die by its content choices. among the experiences i got to try and enjoy was an outerspace simulation called star chart vr, which let me travel from earth to mars to saturn. inside a google arts & culture app, i viewed audio-guided masterpieces by van gogh and other artists. and back inside youtube, i especially enjoyed watching and listening (via spatial 3-d audio) the does not exist vr beatboxing video from reeps one. i also played a game called mekorama, in which you try to help a small robot navigate puzzling mechanical dioramas. in another, called wonderglade, which seems more suited for young kids, i played carnival games in a theme park. still, i wanted more. google lists numerous apps it says will reach daydream before the end of the year. many are from such media properties as bbc, cnn, the new york times and, yes, usa today (vrtually). a number of entertainment-oriented apps are also on the list, including hbo go, hulu vr, jaunt, the nba, nextvr and netflix",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,Google Daydream fulfills wireless VR dreams,11/14/16

"s. destinations in the span of two weeks this fall, industry observers took notice. even before the latest routes were unveiled, british airways flew from more u.s. cities than any other european airline. the addition of fort lauderdale, new orleans and oakland will give the london-based carrier an even bigger presence in the usa as it offers service to 25 airports. the u.s. market has always been uniquely important, says willie walsh, ceo of british airways' parent company international airlines group (iag). ""it shouldn't come as a surprise to people that we're expanding there. i've said it consistently in my time at ba and at iag that i believe that there are opportunities for further expansion into the u.s."" more opportunities could be ahead for aer lingus, too. the irish airline -- which was acquired by iag in 2015 -- expanded its u.s. footprint this year, launching an expansion that brought it to hartford, conn., los angeles and newark. those airports give aer lingus a total of nine destinations in the usa, and walsh said the carrier isn't done. ""we're likely to make an announcement in the near future about another destination for aer lingus in the u.s.,"" walsh said. ""we could have a second."" different factors drive the two airlines' expanded pushes into the american market. aer lingus is driven by a large ""irish diaspora"" living in the usa, as well as by american travelers who are increasingly willing to connect to other european destinations via aer lingus' hub in dublin. ""we call it the accidental hub, because we never really sought out to develop it as a hub. but consumers are smart,"" walsh said. ""so we've got people who've found a way of getting to europe over dublin that's competitive and in many cases much cheaper than your other options."" for british airways, the new orleans route was announced after it said it would discontinue its service between london heathrow and chengdu, china. that freed up ""slots"" at capacity-controlled heathrow, which the carrier opted to use for boeing 787 dreamliner service to new orleans, restoring a route it last flew in the 1980s. there's a different motivation behind british airways' expansion to fort lauderdale and oakland. the airline will serve those markets not from its primary hub at london heathrow but rather from its base at london's gatwick airport, where flight schedules are tilted more toward leisure destinations. gatwick has become one of the top hubs for fast-growing european discount carrier norwegian air, which has used the airport as a base to launch london non-stop flights to eight u.s. destinations. among norwegian air's u.s. destinations served from gatwick: fort lauderdale and oakland. british airways serves both of those regions, flying to miami and to san francisco and san jose in california's bay area. are the new routes a response to upstart norwegian? ""that's a fair comment,"" walsh told usa today. ""norwegian is clearly on their radar,"" said seth kaplan, editor at the airline weekly trade publication. ""this is clearly a signal that they're not going to concede those routes or that leisure segment of the market."" norwegian -- along with icelandic airline wow -- is one of two upstart european ""ultra low-cost carriers"" that have made rapid inroads in the usa, each launching a number of routes to europe during the past few years. both offer rock-bottom base fares but charge extra for everything from carry-on bags to water. though those types of carriers have enjoyed success in europe and the usa, it's only been this decade that they've begun to take meaningful market share on trans-atlantic flights. ""we've watched with interest what norwegian has done,"" walsh said, noting he was initially skeptical fliers would be willing to accept such a no-frills model on long flights over the atlantic. ""we always wondered. if i go back 10 years, we were always debating that ... people would accept that no-frills approach to (short-haul) flying but probably wouldn't take it beyond four hours. and then you can see that four hours is being stretched, and now it's in the trans-atlantic."" here come brits' new flights british airways upcoming u",MONEY; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,"British Airways, Aer Lingus push U.S. growth plan; New destinations offer bigger presence in competitive field",11/14/16

" his win is resuscitating the decades-old debate over whether the supply-side -- derided by democrats as ""trickle-down"" -- tax policy reagan championed can jump-start the listless u.s. economy. the theory: lowering taxes for businesses and wealthy individuals leaves more cash in their pockets, spurring more investment and hiring, and the faster growth generates enough new tax income to pay for the cuts. the top tax rate under reagan was slashed to 28% from 70%, and business deductions became more generous. about 16 million jobs were created during his two terms, and the economy grew as much as 7.3% in 1984. trump proposes chopping the top individual marginal rate to 33% from 40% -- as well as more modest cuts for those with low and moderate incomes -- and the corporate rate to 15% from 35%. the many small-business owners taxed at the individual rate also would pay 15%.

""if you make it cheaper to invest, ultimately, companies are going to grow and hire more people,"" he says. nonsense, says jared bernstein, former chief economist for vice president biden and a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities. first, he says, it's not clear that tax cuts are what juiced the economy in the 1980s, noting reagan spearheaded massive increases in defense spending -- from $325 billion in 1980 to as much $456 billion in 1987 -- that rippled across the economy. the lower taxes and higher military spending nearly tripled the national debt to $2.8 trillion by the time reagan left office, stoking inflation fears that contributed to the recession under president george h.w. bush in 1990-91. president  clinton ""significantly raised taxes and had bigger job gains than reagan,"" bernstein says. about 22 million jobs were created in the eight years clinton was in office, and the economy grew an average 3.8% a year, helped, in part, by a tech boom that turbocharged business productivity. despite tax cuts for the wealthy, the economy slipped into a deep recession in george w. bush's term. bernstein says sharp tax cuts made more sense in the reagan era. the 70% top personal tax rate was far higher than the current 40%, so the massive reduction could have unleashed much more pent-up demand for investment than trump's plan would. besides, while interest rates are near record lows and many companies are awash in cash, it's not as if they don't have easy access to funds for capital spending, bernstein says. yet, he says, many have chosen to buy back stock and fatten dividends. mark zandi, chief economist of moody's analytics, says tax cuts do lead to stronger investment and job growth, but those benefits ""are generally overstated",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Can Trump make 'trickle-down' economics work?; Reagan slashed taxes and increased defense spending, but Clinton created more jobs",11/14/16

" will they keep your checked bag from disappearing the next time you fly? maybe. true, sophisticated new technologies are being introduced that track your belongings from airport to airport. the latest is delta air lines' $50million system, which uses radio frequency id (rfid) cards to keep tabs on your luggage. and fewer checked bags are vanishing as a result. the global airline industry's mishandled baggage rate fell to 6.5 bags per thousand passengers last year, down 10.5% from 2014 year and less than half the rate in 2003, according to the information technology company sita. but don't rely on your airline to track your bags the next time you fly, and even if it does, you shouldn't assume it'll always work. in fact, there are far more reliable ways to ensure your belongings don't get lost than trusting your airline. the most obvious way -- and one that virtually all of the gee-whiz news coverage of tracking systems has missed -- is to never hand your checked bag over to an airline. pack light and tight and use the overhead compartment. it's easy to keep tabs on your bag. just open the bin to make sure it's still there. problem solved. if you must check your bag, consider tracking it yourself. the most popular methods are long-range tracking solutions like luglock and trakdot, and new luggage with built-in sensors. jeffrey kolker has used trakdot, a $49 gadget (service fee not included) that uses cellular technology to keep tabs on his valuables. ""it works,"" says kolker, an accountant from pryor, okla. except when it doesn't. in order to use trakdot's mobile app, you need cellular service or access to wi-fi. on a recent flight to italy, when his bag was lost, he had neither. ""it didn't matter,"" he says. ""the batteries on the trakdot were dead."" experts say the next evolutionary step in tracking technology is luggage with the systems already built in. ""it's a trend,"" says michele marini pittenger, president of the travel goods association, a trade group that represent the luggage industry. the bags, called ""smart"" luggage, use a variety of technologies, including global positioning (gps) and bluetooth, to round up lost bags. the biggest names in smart luggage are bluesmart and raden. bluesmart's one carry-on ($449), for example, uses integrated gps technology to follow your valuables, with no monthly service fee. raden's a22 carry ($295) uses bluetooth technology to track your bag in an airport. both have their own apps that can find and even weigh your luggage. you shouldn't have to embed tracking technology into a carry-on, but then, you can't be too careful these days. who knows when you'll get stuck on a puddlejumper with limited overhead space or run into the most feared flight attendant in the skies, ms. gatecheck? by all accounts, the luggage works. i searched far and wide for someone who had lost one of these trackable bags and couldn't find one (if you're out there, please let me know). in a perfect world, your airline would know where your checked bag is at all times. but it's a process. when patti pizzimenti flew from hartford, conn., to myrtle beach, s.c., recently, american airlines lost her luggage. but pizzimenti, a retired medical worker who lives in hartford, fired up her american airlines app, located her luggage, and was promptly reunited with it. american's system used its conventional barcode scanners to check luggage at various locations, but its app is an important intermediate step toward tracking all bags. problems aside, tracking technology can reduce the loss rate to practically zero, once all the bugs are worked out. the new rfid-based technologies can raise the delivery of bags to near 99%  accuracy from an industry average of around 80%  based on current technology, says pankaj shukla, a director of market development for zebra technologies. ""this also improves customer satisfaction,"" he adds. elliott is an author, consumer advocate and nationally-syndicated columnist how to prevent your checked luggage from getting lost prep your bag. arrive at the airport with plenty of time to check in. your bag should be packed properly, flight-ready and labeled with a tag. watch the gate agent place the tag on your bag and make sure the airport code matches your final destination. ""if you can, take a picture of your bag in case it's lost so you have all the details to complete the forms at baggage claim,"" says todd penny, founder of gocodes, a tracking software company. mark it. why is almost all luggage black? no one knows. but it's a good enough reason to make your black luggage stand out. if you want to make a fashion statement, try a luggage identifier like pom-id ($9 from pomchies.com) a colorful nylon/spandex pom-pom that sets your bag apart. or you could go old school and use neon duct tape, as i do. the results are the same: no one will mistake it for their bag and walk off with it at the carousel. fly an airline that does it well. among the domestic carriers, airlines like jetblue and virgin america have some of the best records for keeping your luggage, and among the legacy airlines delta air lines has a great reputation",MONEY; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,Lost luggage less likely with new tracking systems,11/14/16

""her whole life, she was chasing something,"" new york radio personality mark simone tells bennetts. joan molinsky was an insecure jewish girl from brooklyn (before the family moved to  suburban larchmont) who thought she wasugly and evidently didn't get enough love from her mother. she used to tell this joke: ""i'm the last single girl in larchmont. my mother is desperate. she has a sign up: 'last girl before freeway.'"" but rivers was the queen of reinvention, and eventually she threw aside self-deprecation to become an attack dog, with female celebrities such as elizabeth taylor, angelina jolie and lena dunham in her crosshairs. she invented ""fat-shaming"" and ""slut-shaming."" it worked for her. how did she get there?  fans who read last girl before freeway will learn about rivers' long, slow climb to the top before she took a legendary plunge. johnny carson made rivers a superstar, and when she got her own late-night talk show in 1986 on the fledgling fox network without telling him, there was a huge price to pay. rivers' husband, edgar rosenberg, who managed her career (badly, many thought), killed himself after his wife's talk show tanked. bennetts (the feminine mistake) is particularly strong on this fascinating, difficult period in rivers' life, showing how the comedian pulled herself up through sheer will, overcoming $37 million in debt and refusing to leave the stage.

" answering questions from reporters for the first time since voters handed the white house over to a candidate who promised to dismantle his agenda, obama pledged monday to give president-elect donald trump the space he needs to put together a government. he declined to comment on the appointment of alt-right firebrand stephen bannon to a top role in his white house and steered clear of his campaign remarks that trump was unfit for the presidency. ""look, the people have spoken. donald trump will be the next president, the 45th president of the united states. and it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. and those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. that's how this system operates,"" he said. ""whenever you have got an incoming president of the other side, particularly after a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts."" he gave trump plenty of presidential advice -- on staffing, on reaching out to women and minorities and even on his temperament. he said an offhand remark from the president can move markets and impact national security. ""there are going to be certain aspects of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,"" obama said. on the whole, obama spoke almost admiringly of trump's political skills. ""what's clear is that he was able to tap into -- yes, the anxieties but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,"" he said. that connection with his supporters made him ""impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate."" ""that's powerful stuff,"" he said. trump ""is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with,"" obama said. ""i don't think he is ideological. i think ultimately, he is pragmatic in that way. and that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction."" the news conference provided a way for obama to get domestic politics out of the way before he departs monday night for a weeklong, three-country foreign trip that's likely to be the last of his presidency. ""i figure, why wait?"" he said. that trip -- to greece, germany and peru -- will give obama a chance to reassure allies that bipartisan commitments are more enduring than any one administration. obama also addressed: the future of the affordable care act: ""obviously, this has been a holy grail for republicans over the past six, seven years: 'we've got to kill obamacare.' that's been taken as an article of faith,""  obama said. he argued that the gop has the challenge of improving something that is doing well. ""now comes the hard part,"" he said. his oval office meeting with trump: ""we had a very cordial conversation, and that didn't surprise me,"" he said. ""i think that he is obviously a gregarious person. he's somebody who i think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate."" obama gave trump some practical advice on staffing. ""probably the most important point that i made was that how you staff, particularly the chief of staff, the national security adviser, the white house counsel ... that's something that has to be attended to right away,"" he said. ""i think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that."" obama said he told trump he was encouraged by his more conciliatory tone since the election, but he needs to reach out to women and minority groups to assure them he can be their president, too. ""gestures matter,"" he said. ""and how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, i think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he has actually taken office."" the future of the democratic party: ""it's a healthy thing for the democratic party to go through some reflection. i think it's important for me not to be bigfooting that conversation. we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge,"" he said. the closing of guantanamo bay: ""it is true that i have not been able to close the darned thing, because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us,"" he said of the cuban naval base detention facility that holds captives from the war on terror.

" in her new memoir, settle for more, kelly describes how an unexpectedly anxious trump complained to fox news executives last year about what she'd do as a moderator of the debate. the questions kelly and her colleagues planned to ask the candidates were secret. she wrote that days before the debate, trump called fox ""in an attempt to rein me in. ... he said he had 'heard' that my first question was a very pointed question directed at him."" kelly's first question was in fact for trump and about his treatment  of women. she wondered, she wrote, ""how could he know that?"" in an exclusive interview monday with usa today -- one in which she discussed what she called her ""year of trump"" and her stand against former fox news chief roger ailes -- kelly said she did not believe her question leaked to trump. ""i don't think he had any idea,"" she said. ""what i think he was worried about was his divorce from ivana trump. ... he was afraid i was going to bring that up."" a few weeks before the debate, kelly devoted a segment of her program, the kelly file, to an interview with the author of a report on the daily beast website. it said ivana trump had sworn in divorce papers a quarter-century earlier that trump had raped her -- an accusation she later retracted. kelly said that after the segment aired, an angry trump called and told her, ""i almost unleashed my beautiful twitter account on you, and i still may."" it was a threat on which he soon made good. the author's year of trump began with her now famous question to trump about whether his history with women would be fodder for hillary clinton's claims that he was part of a ""war on women."" it exploded with trump's insinuation that kelly was hostile to him in the debate because she was menstruating and continued until the following april, when the two met in trump's office. by that time, kelly said, she was weary of the abuse prompted by trump's string of insulting social media posts. in the interview, kelly declined to comment on what she said or did at her trump tower meeting to get him to stop. but as a result of the meeting, she said, ""trump and i are in a better place now. we left things on a good note. he's never come after me the way he had. ... even though he held onto his anger toward me like a dog with a bone, he does have the ability to let things go. he proved that."" readers of settle for more may not harbor such optimism. kelly has written a contemporary perils of pauline saga in which the  heroine fends off the advances -- literal and digital -- of two villains: trump and ailes, who resigned in july under duress. the latter, an accused serial sexual harasser (who nonetheless furthered our heroine's career at every turn) gets his just desserts; the former becomes president. during their one-sided feud, trump called kelly a bimbo, a lightweight, a liar, crazy and sick; he urged a boycott against her show; his attorney retweeted a call to ""gut"" her. ""strange men turned up outside"" her door, she wrote. ""death threats were common."" she, her husband and their three children vacationed at disney world with an armed bodyguard in tow. ""he couldn't let it go for so long,"" she said of trump, ""and there was a time when i wondered if he'd ever let it go."" she said she was afraid -- for her safety and her family's and for her reputation as a journalist trying to cover the story and not be the story. in seeking a meeting with trump, kelly said, she took her fate into her own hands -- ""settling for more."" the book's description  goes much further. ""i felt like a hostage whose hostage taker was seeing her as a human being for the very first time -- who needed to believe that he would let her go,"" kelly wrote. when trump greeted her by holding out his arms for a hug, kelly embraced him. ""it felt like a kind gesture,"" she wrote. when he asked for her cellphone number, she worried -- in pique, he'd made gop presidential rival lindsey graham's number public -- but gave it to him. when he suggested they have a picture taken together, she agreed. they posed arm in arm. in retrospect, she wrote, ""i look rather like a person who's been through some sort of trauma and is waiting for the coast guard helicopter."" the reader may understand why kelly felt she needed to go to trump. efforts by ailes, fox's pro-trump host sean hannity and others had failed. ""nothing stopped it,"" she said in the interview. ""i realized no one was coming to save me. if this was going to end, i was the one who was going to have to end it."" the book's penultimate chapter deals with ailes, who kelly said harassed her starting in 2005. in a private meeting in his office, he said he wanted to see her in the ""very sexy bras"" she must own. the following year, she wrote, ailes tried to grab her and kiss her. as she fled out the door, she recalled, he asked, ""when is your contract up?"" when she finally confided to a supervisor, she said, she was told to avoid ailes. after that, the problem stopped. ailes was sued in july for alleged sexual harassment by former fox morning show host gretchen carlson. a week and a half later -- after spurning requests to vouch for ailes -- kelly called the co-chairman of fox's parent company, lachlan murdoch, and reported her own experience. ailes has denied all charges against him. kelly was asked by usa today if she thought that ailes, who continually promoted her -- even while she was on maternity leave -- deserved a second chance in the news business. ""absolutely not,"" she snapped. ""i have no doubts now about who he is or what he did. i don't think he'd have spent a lifetime doing it and suddenly turn over a new leaf."" she said she was disturbed he'd advised the trump campaign. despite trump's attacks, kelly's ratings are as high as ever -- second only to those of her fox  neighbor, bill o'reilly. her fox contract is up next year, and she's the subject of intense speculation over with which network she'll sign (abc is among those interested), for how much (fox may have offered $20 million a year) and to do what (she'd like to do more in-depth interviews). she said she's not concerned by a tweet by trump campaign social media director dan scavino after her on-air tussle last month with trump surrogate newt gingrich. (""she is totally biased against mr. trump & not very smart. .... watch what happens to her after this election is over."") ""that wasn't trump, that was dan scavino, who used to be trump's golf caddy,"" kelly said. trump has observed his truce with kelly since what she calls their ""trump tower accords."" he has yet to comment on her book, which goes on sale tuesday. after her flap with gingrich, trump tweeted, ""congratulations, newt ... that was an amazing interview. we don't play games, newt, right? we don't play games."" whatever's next between kelly and trump, she said his campaign against her is an ominous precedent: ""i have a big mic, and i was established. he couldn't really destroy me,"" she said, ""but think about the message that was sent to other journalists thinking about covering him skeptically",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Kelly survived 'Year of Trump'; Fox News anchor recounts bullying and how they reached accord,11/15/16

" if obama is to be kept to his word, neither will former cia director david petraeus, convicted israeli spy jonathan pollard, intelligence contractor edward snowden or pvt. chelsea manning, all of whom were accused or convicted of mishandling classified information. the reason is simple: none of them has applied to the office of the pardon attorney for executive clemency. obama addressed ""last-minute"" presidential pardons at a news conference in august. ""the process that i put in place is not going to vary depending on how close i get to the election,"" he said in response to a question from usa today. ""so it's going to be reviewed by the pardon attorney, it will be reviewed by my white house counsel, and i'm going to, as best as i can, make these decisions based on the merits, as opposed to political considerations."" speculation about a clinton pardon, already rampant before the election, intensified after the election of rival donald trump as president. at one debate, trump told clinton it would be bad for her if he was elected ""because you'd be in jail."" trump aides have refused to rule out a prosecution after inauguration day. that posture could increase pressure on obama to pardon clinton, but there's no indication that she's sought a pardon -- or that she would accept one if granted. though some pardons have been granted on the grounds of innocence, they're often perceived as a sign of guilt. it's not necessary for someone to be charged or convicted of a crime to receive a pardon. president gerald ford pardoned his predecessor, richard nixon, in 1974, although nixon had not been charged or convicted of a crime. nixon resigned in august 1974 after the house judiciary committee approved two articles of impeachment against him. ""granting a pardon to hillary clinton would be one of the most controversial and misguided clemency decisions that obama could make,"" said jeffrey crouch, a professor at american university and author of the presidential pardon power. ""pardoning a former member of his administration to spare her from the hassle and embarrassment of judicial prosecution would be against what the framers of the constitution had in mind for the clemency power. it would also violate his pledge not to grant any politically motivated pardons in his last days in office."" there are also practical considerations: the office of the pardon attorney puts most of its resources into the clemency initiative, obama's strategy to cut short long mandatory minimum sentences imposed during the ""war on drugs."" there's just not enough time for a new pardon application to get to obama's desk without taking shortcuts. the white house has expedited pardon applications. former pardon attorney margaret love said the white house could put pressure on the justice department to speed up the process. far more likely are what she called ""little people cases"" -- people who aren't household names but can carry historic resonance. among them: sala udin, a former pittsburgh city council member and civil rights activist convicted of transporting firearms across state lines in 1970. he was returning home from registering african americans to vote in mississippi when police in kentucky pulled him over for speeding and found an unloaded rifle. udin explained that he brought the weapon in case he was ""trapped on some lonely, dark road in the south and confronted by klansmen who threatened to kill me."" his pardon petition has been pending with the office of the pardon attorney since 2008. those aren't always the kinds of cases that are subject to newspaper headlines and online petition campaigns, which seek to do an end run around the justice department and put political pressure directly on the white house. that's the strategy employed by edward snowden, the former national security agency contractor exiled in russia to avoid charges that he violated the espionage act. his lawyer, ben wizner of the american civil liberties union, acknowledged that his client doesn't meet the justice department guidelines to be eligible for a pardon. ""the constitution didn't assign this power to the department of justice. it assigned it to the president,"" wizner said in august. ""i would hope that president obama would like to resolve this situation on his watch."" other notable cases that don't have petitions pending  include former alabama governor don siegelman (corruption), ""american taliban"" john walker lindh (terrorism) and lifestyle guru martha stewart (insider trading). there are still some prominent names that could -- at least theoretically -- receive clemency. the office of the pardon attorney confirmed that it has pending applications from former detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick (racketeering, extortion, bribery and fraud), native american activist leonard peltier (murder), former worldcom ceo bernard ebbers (fraud and conspiracy) and singer ron isley (tax evasion). then there's the exceptional case of jack johnson, the african-american boxing champion convicted in 1912 of transporting a woman across state lines for immoral purposes. several congressional resolutions have urged obama to grant a pardon to johnson on grounds that the trial was racially motivated. until recently, the justice department wouldn't even accept a posthumous pardon application.  ""it is the department's position that the limited resources which are available to process requests for president clemency -- now being submitted in record numbers -- are best dedicated to requests submitted by persons who can truly benefit from a grant of the request,"" then-pardon attorney ron rogers wrote to congress in 2009. but acting pardon attorney robert zausmer confirmed that a petition had been submitted on johnson's behalf, suggesting an open case",NEWS; Pg. 4A,USA TODAY,"Little chance Obama will pardon Clinton, and here's why",11/15/16
" jeff sessions knows something about fences. the alabama senator, a leading congressional opponent of overhauling immigration laws, has spent the better part of the past decade trying to fortify the border between the usa and mexico, achieving mixed results. a strong candidate for a job in the cabinet of president-elect donald trump, sessions could gain the power of the executive branch and the imprimatur to finish the task. ""the crisis at the southwest border highlights the simple fact that without barriers to prevent the illegal entry of additional aliens, the brave men and women of the u.s. border patrol simply do not have enough personnel to detain and deport all illegal border crossers,"" sessions said eight days before trump won the election. one of trump's most indelible campaign promises was to erect a wall along the 2,000-mile southern border, up to 55 feet tall, paid for by the mexican government. in his first post-election comments about the border, trump told cbs' 60 minutes that he would be open to a combination of walls and fencing to block undocumented border crossers. ""i'm very good at this, it's called construction,"" trump said. if sessions is named secretary of homeland security, he will be in charge of immigration enforcement and border security, putting responsibility for his long-sought wall directly on his desk. eleven years ago, he worked the halls of capitol hill to generate support for a 2,000-mile, $4billion-$8billion fence but was unsuccessful. ten years ago, he was a leading proponent of the secure fence act, which required double-layered fencing along five segments of the southwestern border of about 700 miles total. in subsequent years, he's tried to carve out money to finance the construction. in the 2016 fiscal year that just ended, authorities apprehended almost 409,000 people attempting to cross the border in the southwest, up from 331,000 last year. ""those who attempt to enter our country without authorization should know that, consistent with our laws and our values, we must and we will send you back,"" homeland security secretary jeh johnson said thursday. that's not good enough for sessions or trump, who say the border remains porous, threatening national security and the economy. sessions has been a leading critic of president obama's immigration policy, and he found a receptive ally in trump. sessions was the first sitting u.s. senator to endorse him in the republican primary.  ""donald trump will build the wall,"" sessions declared at the republican national convention in cleveland. frank sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group america's voice, called sessions the most anti-immigrant member of the senate.

" u.s. forces and allies in japan and south korea are on alert for a new missile launch after recent satellite imagery that showed what appeared to be potential preparations at north korea's sohae launch facility. north korea has carried out two nuclear weapons tests and dozens of missile tests and launches this year in defiance of united nations sanctions. although not all the missile tests have been successful, the north has made significant advances in developing nuclear weapons and the technology needed to mount them to long-range missiles. south korea's joint chiefs of staff said last week  it was closely monitoring moves by the north korean military at its punggye-ri nuclear test site and other possible missile-launching sites and is prepared to respond to any provocative acts, south korea's yonhap news agency reported. ""north korea is preparing more launches, and it has also been continuously showing eagerness about nuclear tests and miniaturization of nuclear warheads,"" japanese defense minister tomomi inada said recently in tokyo. north korea's leaders have often timed weapons tests or other provocative actions to key dates and events at home or overseas as a way of drawing attention to its demands. about 36,000 u.s. and japanese troops and hundreds of aircraft and warships took part in a major exercise held every two years that ended friday in and around japan and the western pacific that was pegged, at least in part, to ballistic missile defense. in a statement last month, u.s. forces-japan said training scenarios  would include ""integrated air and missile defense and ballistic missile defense in order to keep pace with the growing ballistic missile threat in the indo-asia-pacific region."" north korea's advances in nuclear weapons and missile technology make defense planners ""nervous and alarmed,"" said narushige michishita, director of the security and international studies program at the national graduate institute for policy studies in tokyo. he said the most recent nuclear test, in september, showed north korea is capable of building a weapon equivalent in power to the atomic bomb used on hiroshima in world war ii. north korea has at least 12, and perhaps as many as 20, functional nuclear weapons and is likely to have an arsenal of 50 to 100 nuclear weapons within the next five years, michishita said. north korea has 200 to 320 medium-range nodong ballistic missiles that can reach major cities in japan, along with key u.s. military bases there. the longer-range musudan missile could threaten u.s. bases in guam and alaska. north korea is developing two other missile variants with range to strike parts of the continental usa. national intelligence director james clapper said last month that persuading north korea to give up its nuclear weapons program is a ""lost cause",NEWS; Pg. 11A,USA TODAY,U.S. on alert for new nuclear or missile tests by N.

""greece is not going to get out of this crisis, whatever he says,"" the 38-year-old child psychologist said. protests that are likely to greet obama are also pointless, she said. the greek government, by contrast, sees obama's two-day visit as his presidency ends as vital for convincing the country's foreign lenders to reach a new agreement on restructuring greece's debt and shoring up political leaders with disillusioned voters. left-wing prime minister alexis tsipras' popularity sank after he broke campaign pledges by hiking taxes and slashing spending to pay interest on massive loans greece accumulated. his moves to revitalize the economy have not yielded many changes. more than a quarter of greeks have lost their jobs, while a third of the population live near the poverty line. many educated youths have left the country, raising concerns about a brain drain. and the country is stuck in a downward spiral of joblessness and a lack of government and consumer spending to turn things around. ""the economic crisis is still ongoing because the government and society perpetuate the same problems that led us to the crisis,"" said dimitris charalambis, a university of athens political scientist.

""the university is barely surviving,"" charalambis said. athens is full of similar examples that illustrate how public services are deteriorating, such as pothole-laden streets, crumbling sidewalks and cars parked in places that block pedestrian crossings. ""the crisis drastically influenced the quality of my life,"" said gertsou, who is visually impaired and walks with a dog and cane. ""there is no pavement restoration work anymore, so my moving around the city is constantly getting more difficult.

" but so far, the billionaire businessman's election win has been bullish for the dow jones industrial average, bucking a trend of stocks trading lower after white house control switches to a new party and raising hopes for a traditional year-end rally. while stocks' recent gains are largely being attributed to the market getting more comfortable with trump's style and proposed policies, year-end rallies are common in most years, with the dow gaining 1.8%, on average, from election day through  dec. 31. in presidential election years, however, that gain shrinks to around 1.4%. and gains typically turn to losses of nearly 1.5% in election years when a new party wins the white house, as it did last week when democrat hillary clinton lost the race. the dow has traded higher in the four trading days since trump's win, signaling wall street is coming around to trump's contention that as a businessman he knows what it takes to make an economy grow and thrive. the dow has rallied more than 535 points, or nearly 3%, since the nov. 8 market close, notching three fresh records and eclipsing its average 1.43% election year gain it normally posts from the day after the vote to year-end, according to schaeffer's investment research. hopes for a year-end rally have been driven by wall street reassessing trump's policies and concluding that his platform of lower taxes, fiscal spending and less regulation of business would be growth-friendly and offset potential negative effects of his more restrictive views on global trade and immigration. but not all the market math adds up to a slam-dunk bullish end to the year. for one, not all stocks are rising. the technology-heavy nasdaq composite, for example, has closed lower two of the past three trading sessions and is up just 0.5% since election day. trump has taken aim at online retailer amazon.com, saying it controls too much of retail commerce, and has criticized iphone maker apple for manufacturing its gadgets overseas. another potential weight on stocks is an interest rate hike from the federal reserve next month and the more recent spike in u.s. government bond yields. a bond market sell-off has pushed up the yield on the 10-year treasury note to more than 2.2%, its highest level since the start of the year. ""the change in yields warrants attention,"" jason trennert of wall street firm strategas research partners, wrote in a report. low borrowing costs have been a boon to stocks. still, if investors betting on a better economy going forward are right, stocks could finish out the year strong as they tend to do in this seasonally bullish period, notes ryan detrick, senior market strategist at lpl financial. detrick's data show the broad market has gained an average of 2.5% in the last two months of the final year of a president's term and finished up 75% of the time. and with the ""economy on firm footing now"" and no recession on the horizon, detrick says that's ""another positive"" working in the market's favor. of course, the market's momentum could also be derailed if trump keeps his hardline stance on immigration and trade, which could spook markets. the combination of a strong seasonal period for stocks coupled with the realization that trump's policies backed by a republican congress could lead to a ""spike in growth"" bodes well for stocks, says jamie cox, managing partner at harris financial",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"After 'Trump bounce,' rally may have legs; President-elect's fiscal policies getting second look from Wall Street",11/15/16
" only time will tell if the republican's policies will provide much more of a boost to u.s. oil and gas, which has rallied in recent years thanks to technologies that enable production from previously untapped shale reserves. moreover, it's price, not government regulation, that really determines the extent of oil and gas exploration and production, as thomas watters, a managing director with s&p global ratings, observed recently. asked during a webinar sponsored by the ratings agency what impact trump's pro-drilling stance would have on producers, watters said offering an answer is difficult because the president-elect's statements on oil and gas are ""lacking in detail at this point."" ""it's clear that he's talked about relaxing environmental regulations, and that would obviously bode well for the drillers and what not, and that would include opening up some federal lands that have been restricted, both onshore and offshore,"" watters said. ""but just to be clear, the drilling activity ... that we have seen in the u.s. wasn't due to regulation, it was due to economics. so, at the end of the day, it's going to be about where oil prices are and how producers react to that."" on that score, much rides not on washington but on opec and whether saudi arabia and other members of the oil cartel reach an agreement to limit production when they meet in vienna on nov. 30. without an accord, ""we do believe that oil could touch below $40 a barrel in the near term,"" watters said. that would spell more bad news for producers, who have seen prices for west texas intermediate rally from a 13-year low of $26.21 a barrel feb. 11 to $50.43 oct. 20, though they've fallen since then to $43.67 monday. it was no coincidence that downgrades surged among exploration and production companies rated by s&p in the first quarter of 2016, a trend that tapered off as prices recovered in the following months."" ""prices were going off the cliff,"" watters said of that period early this year. ""it was like trying to catch a falling knife."" if opec fails to strike an agreement this month, producers in the usa and around the world face the risk of another downturn in prices, he warned. that said, striking a deal will be difficult for the oil cartel, which is producing at record levels. the international energy agency estimates that opec members pumped 33.8 million barrels a day in october after production recovered in nigeria and libya and hit an all-time high in iraq. that's nearly 1.3 million barrels a day above levels one year ago and well beyond the production ceiling of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day the cartel set as a goal at a meeting in algiers in september. ""we can't predict the outcome of the 30 november meeting, but we can see the scale of the task ahead,"" paris-based iea noted in a report last week. moreover, opec is not the only factor at play in global oil markets. the iea projects a 500,000-barrel increase in daily output from russia and other non-opec countries in 2017. ""if the opec countries do implement their algiers resolution, the resultant production cut will see the market move from surplus to deficit very quickly in 2017, albeit with a considerable stock overhang that will take time to deplete,"" the iea said. ""on the other hand, if no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production, then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher. indeed, if the supply surplus persists in 2017, there must be some risk of prices falling back."" u.s. shale producers, hoping for a jump in prices, will continue to drive better deals with their contractors and find ways of operating more efficiently at lower prices.

" ""i think we'll ultimately win, yes,"" the lyft co-founder tells usa today. ""our focus on the u.s. has been helpful."" lyft has indeed taken a narrower path to success by focusing on the domestic market. founded in 2012, three years after uber created the category, lyft made itself known with the fuzzy pink mustaches that adorned its cars. but zimmer's confidence is mitigated by the fact this battle is getting grizzly, thanks largely to uber's mushrooming footprint. reports surfaced this summer, which lyft executives denied, that the company was shopping itself to a range of suitors -- including uber. by most standards, lyft has done well with venture capitalists. the company has raised $2billion, which includes a $500million investment from general motors in late 2015. its private market valuation is estimated at $5.5billion. it has 315,000 drivers and just hit 17million rides a month, up from 7million a year ago. in contrast, uber has raised $15 billion, is valued at $68billion and operates in more than 60 countries. it has more than a million drivers and has completed 2 billion rides. and while little is known about the exact unit economics of both companies, the widely held belief is both are using their capital to keep prices low in order to grow market share. uber recently shelved its plans to compete in china after an expensive incentives program that failed to dent rival didi chuxing. when contemplating the financial path forward, consider that both zimmer and uber ceo travis kalanick have made plain their desire to provide a service that eliminates, for many people, the need to own a vehicle. once that hook is set, ride-hailing  companies could add a premium to mobility as a service and the public would have to ride along. ride-hailing  is thought to be a $40 billion market, and given the fairly low barrier to entry -- namely compelling tech -- there are likely to be more entrants into the space. in the meantime, however, zimmer and his team still need to make sure they're top of mind for consumers. ""we have enough drivers now so that customers can count on a lyft arriving within three minutes,"" says zimmer, 32. ""once you can compete on price and estimated time of arrival, then the winner is whoever has the best experience."" lyft's new amp, a cylindrical dash-mounted device aimed at making pickups trouble-free, is one move in the customer-experience direction. by matching colors between the amp's screen and a rider's lyft app, the company hopes to streamline the curbside process. lyft also differs from uber in that it allows customers the option of tipping. while zimmer would not provide details on how many riders tip and how much, he says lyft drivers have ""10% higher earnings"" than rival drivers, and that since he and co-founder logan green launched the service in 2012 some $100 million in tips have been doled out by appreciative riders. ultimately, zimmer says he and green have a broader vision than simply providing consumers with rides. they want to help eliminate car ownership altogether. ""every year in this country, $2.1 trillion is spent on car ownership, which is around $9,000 per vehicle per year, and that car is typically only used 4% of the time,"" he says. ""when i went to hotel school, they taught us about how important occupancy was. well, 4% occupancy isn't great."" zimmer recently wrote in a medium post titled ""the third transportation revolution: lyft's vision for the next ten years and beyond,"" that consumers could expect a driverless lyft ride within five years. he also predicted that private car ownership in major cities would be all but obsolete by 2025 and that cities will reclaim acres of public space now dedicated to parking lots. ""we'll still need drivers for quite some time,"" he says. ""for one, you'll have many routes (outside of urban cores) that won't be something self-driving cars can handle. and then you'll have a need for a human being for things like rides for the elderly or handicapped",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"'We'll ultimately win,' Lyft's Zimmer says of Uber battle",11/15/16
" the ride-hailing service announces tuesday that come december, drivers will begin replacing the company's dash-mounted glowing pink mustache -- dubbed the glowstache -- with an interactive cylindrical gadget called the amp, so named because it is meant to amplify each lyft ride. ""we went through many different shapes and models, and what we've ended up with has the fun of the glowstache while adding a new in-car experience,"" lyft co-founder john zimmer tells usa today. ""we want to treat drivers and passengers better."" he means better than the competition, which would be uber. that crosstown rival has also been making changes to its service, from offering its contractor drivers access to online retirement planning services to a recent app reboot that providers riders with what ceo travis kalanick called ""in-flight entertainment."" lyft, meanwhile, allows passengers the option of tipping after a ride, which zimmer says leads to 10% higher earnings for its drivers. although the company says it welcomed 1 million new riders last month, lyft continues to face pressure from its larger rival. uber has secured some $15 billion in funding at a valuation of $68 billion. lyft has raised $2 billion at a valuation of $5.5 billion, a sliver of uber's haul. kalanick has said that he hopes to put off an initial public offering for some time. for lyft, reports have surfaced that the service was shopping itself around. notwithstanding these differences, both are still dealing with some basics of ride-hailing -- getting the customer cheaply and quickly from a to b. some seven years into the ride-hailing phenomenon, one issue that has vexed players is making sure riders and drivers find each other. often the only sign a pedestrian could be waiting for a ride is a tightly clutched cellphone (studying the vehicle's approach). uber recently sought to solve for this problem with a revamped app that offers customers a choice of curbside pickup locations, in addition to the continued option of dropping a map pin in a location of their choosing. while the glowstache merely signaled to a waiting rider that the approaching vehicle was a lyft car, the amp's mission is to eliminate any confusion that can occur at the moment of pickup. the outward facing screen of the amp, which is shaped like a beats pill speaker, can change from pink to a custom color that matches a hue on the rider's lyft app; if two lyft rides happen to pull up on the same corner, you'll know which car is yours via the device's color. once a rider enters the vehicle, the backside of amp will spell out a personal greeting, further confirming you're in the right car. zimmer says the company will continue to explore ways in which the amp can add a personalized feel to a lyft ride. ""one idea is that say the (golden state) warriors win, then in san francisco the amp can turn blue and gold,"" he says. the amp looks rudimentary, almost a throwback to a taxi's dome light. amp will glow pink when a driver is on the road but switch to a passenger's custom color about a mile before the pickup spot. ""we've been on this for a year- and-a-half and at one point had something baton-shaped called the wand,"" says ethan eyler, who heads the rider experience team and was behind the original pink 'stache. ""in the end we went back to wanting to own the space on the dash."" as 21st-century tech devices go, amp remains rather rudimentary. but that's by design. lyft's approach stands in contrast to uber's, whose new app encourages riders to put their heads down and peruse ubereats options or pandora music details during the ride.

" triumphant republicans, on the other hand, feel energized and exultant over the electorate's unexpected right turn, with newly mobilized hordes surging to the polls to power gop victories at every level. in the midst of such emotional reactions to the recent contest, both sides should take a few deep breaths and pause for a closer look at the actual numbers that emerged from the election. these figures provide little reason for democratic desperation, and scant basis for swelling republican confidence in facing the future. the most striking aspect of the popular vote total for the triumphant trump is how ordinary, how predictable, how underwhelming his actual support turned out to be. amazingly, trump has received 554,000 fewer votes than mitt romney in 2012. 'compassionate' w. as a matter of fact, the ""compassionate conservative"" george w. bush received 1.7 million more votes in his successful 2004 campaign than trump drew in his ""make america great again"" crusade 12 years later. it's also worth noting that bush drew stronger response at the polls despite the fact that there were 11 million fewer potential voters. these numbers contradict conventional wisdom: president-elect trump didn't base his startling upset on some new surge of indignant blue-collar true believers who had failed to mobilize for prior candidates. in fact, among first-time voters (just 10% of the electorate in 2016, according to exit polls), hillary clinton won handily -- 56% to 40%, with the rest going to minor-party candidates. how, then, did trump beat clinton? the answer is, she beat herself. as a washington veteran and a status-quo candidate, she inspired far less enthusiasm than the charismatic avatar of hope and change, barack obama. while trump slightly underperformed more standard-issue republicans, clinton fared far worse than prior democrats -- getting more than 8 million fewer votes than obama in 2008. even john kerry, who ran a dispirited losing campaign in 2004, achieved a nearly identical vote total to clinton's, despite more than 5% growth in the electorate since then. these incontestable facts should provide some comfort for depressed democrats, and raise some serious concerns for resurgent republicans. for democrats, this year's electoral college defeat hardly amounts to some sweeping rejection of the party's brand.  democrats will win again with candidates who inspire passion more than grudging respect, and with even greater focus on the mechanics of drawing liberal leaners to the polls. trumpian boasts republicans must recognize that trumpian boasts about inspiring fresh recruits to flock to the gop banner, of persuading enthusiastic hordes to mobilize for the first time to the conservative cause, lack all basis in the actual numbers. despite the unconventional aspects of his campaign, trump fared about as well as a conventional republican -- no better, and only slightly worse. most important, he failed to make significant progress on the principal task highlighted in the republican party's much-discussed ""autopsy"" that followed romney's painful defeat: generating more support among black, latino and asian voters. trump drew only 8% of african-american voters (compared with romney's 6%) and only 29% of both hispanics and asians (to romney's 27%). these figures would have spelled disaster against a more formidable candidate than clinton and will likely doom republican hopes without meaningful improvement in outreach efforts. with the percentage of non-white voters rising significantly every four years, the gop has no future without incorporating far more ethnic diversity into its base. yes, the election returns established upcoming republican control in every branch and at all levels of government. but that advantage won't change the facts of a polarized, nearly even partisan split in public opinion and the likelihood of more unpredictable, highly competitive campaigns that await this weary, wary nation in the years ahead",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Democratic apocalypse (not) now; Trump and the GOP didn't win; Clinton and the Democrats lost,11/15/16

" the decision by the home-sharing site comes a week after a judge indicated he would likely rule against airbnb in a lawsuit against the city over regulations. the shift comes as cities worldwide struggle with a shortage of rental units, which critics say is exacerbated by units being taken off the rental market because they're more lucrative as short-term rentals. san francisco-based airbnb has facilitated thousands of such listings and fought back hard against attempts to regulate it. this change in stance could be an example of airbnb adapting to a changing environment, said susan wachter, a professor of real estate at the wharton school in pennsylvania. ""this is an example of how airbnb may have to be flexible in order to expand its market share. its potential is extraordinary, but in the end it's going to have to deal with local regulatory bodies. regulation is inevitable,"" she said. airbnb on monday said it would craft a mandatory host registration system for the city and will provide san francisco with a list of names, addresses and guest-stays for its hosts. once the system is in place, the company agreed to cap listings of whole houses or apartments to 90 days per year, as required under a city regulation passed in 2015. in an editorial in the san francisco chronicle, airbnb admitted it has made its share of mistakes along the way but is making progress and now ""is ready and willing to do more to address the specific problems that remain,"" chris lehane wrote monday. the company also agreed to deal with an extremely hot-button issue in san francisco: short-term rental of apartments whose tenants have been evicted under the state's ellis act, which allows landlords who want to get out of the business of renting to evict tenants. those units then cannot legally be rented for five years. critics have alleged that apartments emptied by landlords were being rented by the day on airbnb. the company also said it would ensure no ellis act apartments were rented to travelers. under current san francisco rules, airbnb hosts can rent individual rooms in their homes as many days a year as they want, while whole-house or apartment rentals are capped at 90 days. however, the city's board of supervisors, the local equivalent of the city council, is considering even stronger regulations on short-term rentals, limiting them to just 60 days a year, down from the current 365. the move came a week after u.s. district judge james donato made it seem likely he'd find for san francisco in a suit filed by airbnb that claimed the site wasn't responsible for its users who didn't follow local regulations and that it was protected under free speech rules because it was simply the publisher of the listings. donato denied a request for a preliminary injunction by airbnb last week, indicating he found merit in san francisco's arguments that it has the right to regulate the service. airbnb had launched multiple suits against municipalities that want to regulate its hosts, including san francisco, anaheim and santa monica, calif., chicago and the state of new york. the fact airbnb has backed down with san francisco could embolden other cities and  seems to indicate a change of course in the company's response to such suits",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,"Airbnb agrees to regulations in San Francisco; In shift, home-sharing site will respect city's demands to cap apartment rentals at 90 days",11/15/16

" here's the pothole: experts are split over the viability of a plan to use private financing to fund the program to appease a deficit-averse republican congress. ""americans deserve a reliable and efficient transportation network,"" trump's transition website says. his economic advisors say the program would create about 3.3 million construction and other related jobs. and moody's analytics says it would add about 0.4 percentage points a year to economic growth. the nation needs to spend about $3.3 trillion the next decade to fix infrastructure, and there's currently a $1.4 trillion funding gap, according to the american society of civil engineers. such improvements, it says, also would add about $4 trillion to gross domestic product by enhancing productivity. yet trump's website provides no details on how to pay for the proposal. a spokeswoman for the president-elect did not respond to a request for comment. during the campaign, trump touted a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nation's frayed airports, bridges highways, ports and waterways. two of his economic advisors -- business professor peter navarro of the university of california-irvine and private equity investor wilbur ross -- laid out a blueprint to finance the spending with investor money that theoretically would add nothing to the deficit. under the plan, private firms would put up about 20% of the cost and borrow the rest. the government would provide tax credits to cover 82% of their investment. as a result, the firms would need to earn about a 10% return only on the rest of their investment not covered by the tax credits. what's more, navarro and ross contend, stronger revenue for construction firms involved in the projects and higher wages for their workers would generate enough economic activity and government tax revenue to pay for the credits -- without adding to the deficit. but where do these private investors come from? navarro and ross say some could be found among the multinationals with about $2 trillion in profits parked overseas. trump already has proposed allowing them to bring the money back to the u.s. at a discounted 10% tax. many could take part in the infrastructure program and receive credits that offset the 10% tax. michael likosky, head of the infrastructure practice for 32 advisors, believes it could all work. some of the projects could generate enough revenue through tolls on highways or bridges to net a healthy profit for investors. in other cases, he says, state or local governments could pay fees to the investors to provide a return on their money. the benefits for the government: a shorter timeline to complete the projects; a longer than usual period to pay back the money; and the ability to keep the debt off their balance sheets. others are dubious. ""our view is that this particular plan is seriously flawed,"" says paul van de water, senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities. he says many projects, such as expanding broadband to schools, would not lend themselves to tolls or other fees. and, he says, it's not clear why state or local governments would pay higher returns to private investors when they can just issue bonds at historically low interest rates. van de water is also skeptical that the additional economic activity generated by the projects can pay for the tax credits, describing the idea as ""fanciful."" it would be more practical, he says, for the government to simply borrow money for the upgrades, noting that alone would not add much to the budget deficit, which was $587 billion in fiscal 2016, down from $1.4 trillion in 2009. the bigger threat to the deficit, he says, is trump's tax cuts, which the tax policy center says  would add $6.2 trillion to the u.s. debt the next decade. and economist chris lafakis of moody's analytics says the added spending would stoke inflation and drive up interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Trump infrastructure plan hits pothole; Experts divided over investor funding for rebuilding proposal,11/16/16

" the rise in the yield on the 10-year treasury note from 1.86% on election day to an intraday high of 2.31% monday -- its highest level of the year -- is being eyed with caution. the reason: low interest rates have been a key driver of the nearly 8-year-old bull market in stocks. despite yields moving lower to 2.22% tuesday, the latest spike in rates comes as the u.s. stock market is pricey by historical standards, making it vulnerable. the recent surge in bond yields has been driven in large part by president-elect donald trump's pro-growth fiscal plans, which include tax cuts and government spending on infrastructure. though these policy moves could lead to stronger economic growth, they could also result in higher inflation. bond investors fret over a possible interest rate hike next month from the federal reserve, which would mark the u.s. central bank's first rate increase since december 2015. stock investors who remained upbeat on equities, anticipating that the fed would keep rates ""lower for longer,"" now grapple with the likelihood of less fed stimulus. ""since the regime change in washington,"" says trip miller, founder and managing partner at gullane capital, ""there's definitely a push for lower taxes and to prime the pump"" as trump looks to bolster the economy. the trade-off is that pushes interest rates up.

" as soon as donald trump won the presidential election last week, gop lawmakers began scrambling to research the approximately 180 regulations that have been finalized since mid-may and may be eligible for repeal under a rarely used law called the congressional review act. republicans can undo any of those regulations they don't like if they act fast after trump is sworn into office jan. 20. ""i'm sure there will be a dirty dozen,""  rep. darrell issa, r-calif., said when asked how many regulations he expects to be targeted. issa has a bill before the house this week that would allow the new congress to repeal multiple regulations at once rather than having to vote on them one at a time. among the likely targets: a rule from the environmental protection agency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial trucks and buses, and a rule from the labor department to raise the salary threshold for workers eligible for overtime pay from $455 a week to $913 a week. ""it all depends on how aggressive republicans want to be,"" said sam batkins, director of regulatory policy at american action forum, a non-profit think-tank that describes itself as center-right. ""the law they're using is a pretty blunt instrument."" it also depends on how soon congress adjourns its ""lame duck"" session, which began monday. the new congress, which will convene jan. 3, will be able to count back 60 days from the final legislative day of the current congress to find regulations eligible to be repealed. congress has taken so much time off for elections and political conventions that the house has been in session less than 50 days from may 17 through tuesday. lawmakers are scheduled to work, at most, 14 more days this year before they adjourn. the earlier congress adjourns, the further back in time lawmakers can go to target the 2016 rules they don't like. some regulations finalized in may, including the overtime pay rule, may be left intact if congress waits  until its scheduled end-date of dec. 16 to adjourn. ""every day we're in session, we're burning one of those days,"" issa said. the new congress will have 45 legislative days to repeal any eligible rule it doesn't like. the congressional review act of 1996, which has been used successfully only once in 20 years, speeds up the repeal process by requiring only a simple majority to undo regulations. that means senate democrats can't mount a filibuster to stop republicans from acting. trump is likely to sign legislation that would repeal obama administration rules. obama, not surprisingly, vetoed four resolutions passed by congress to overturn his regulations. batkins, like issa, predicted  the new congress will leave the majority of the regulations intact. batkins has compiled a list of 180 regulations that took effect from may 17 through last week. ""i don't anticipate the republicans going after dozens of regulations,"" he said. ""some of the rules are designed to fix something on a plane, for example. that's not the kind of thing they want to repeal. there are roughly 20 to 30 regulations that might be considered controversial."" the house is scheduled to vote this week on issa's midnight rules relief act, which would amend the congressional review act to allow congress to repeal multiple regulations at once. issa said his bill, approved by the house judiciary committee in september, would help rein in costly last-minute regulations by presidents of either party.

" if the anthem controversy has lost a little steam in recent weeks since kaepernick has been joined by only a handful of players in taking a knee, monday night's game in mexico city between the oakland raiders and houston texans could add a dimension to the conversation. ""i am ready,"" hector diaz, 24, said as he prepared to attend monday's game at the cavernous azteca stadium with a group of friends. ""when they play the anthem ... i am going to boo."" for sure, there are conflicted feelings in mexico about its neighbors to the north after the presidential campaign and last week's election of donald trump. in addition to wanting to build a wall along the border -- and insisting mexico pay for it -- trump has called mexicans migrating to the usa criminals and racists. no one is quite certain how feelings about the president-elect will manifest themselves monday when the star-spangled banner is played before the nfl's first regular season excursion into mexico since 2005. ""i will be at the game, and i think some people will boo (the anthem),"" said stephen sanchez, a raiders fan who will travel from his home in monterrey in northern mexico. ""people will maybe feel there is even more reason to now."" when the u.s. soccer team has played at azteca stadium for world cup qualifying games in recent years, the anthem has been routinely jeered by virtually the entire crowd. at major boxing events in the usa featuring mexican fighters such as juan manuel marquez or canelo alvarez, there has been a similar response. ""the booing of the national anthem is actually a misconstrued way of them celebrating their own anthem,"" former u.s. soccer player eric wynalda said. ""i've played many times against mexico, and i think it's just part of the rivalry."" by their nature, the growing number of american football fans in mexico have at least some affinity for the usa, if only an appreciation for the national sport. ""in mexico, two sentiments co-exist,"" historian raul figueroa esquer, a professor at mexico's national autonomous institute of technology, said. ""one historical sentiment ... has an anti-american (basis). at the same time, there is a sentiment of admiration for the most powerful, or one of the most powerful, countries in the world. ""(trump) has had an effect by making negative comments, calling (mexican people) rapists. it is frankly painful that he makes menacing claims about building a stronger wall and having mexico pay for it."" kaepernick's gesture, intended as a protest of social injustices, has divided opinion in the usa: many are outraged by the actions of the san francisco 49ers quarterback and other players, but a large number support his right to freedom of speech and expression. outright booing may be seen different. ""here is the funny thing, i love america, and i go there all the time,"" diaz said. ""when it is a soccer game, it just means we want to beat your team. this time, i will be booing the bad parts of america: trump, intolerance, racism, how some people feel towards mexicans. but i still love american football, and yes, i still love america."" in mexico, there is a clear class and wealth divide between the hardcore supporters of major soccer teams and fans of the nfl. american football, according to marketing expert manuel juarez, is very much a middle-class game, while soccer is the sport of the masses. ""i really don't think and i would not expect the mexican people would boo when the u.s. national anthem would be sung or played (for the nfl game),"" juarez said.

""it's not a blind trust when you know what's in it,"" painter said of trump's plan to let his children and executives take over the company. he said trump could run afoul of the emoluments clause of the constitution if his companies conduct business with overseas companies tied to foreign governments. the clause bars federal officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. painter, who backed democrat hillary clinton's candidacy, said trump should move to convert his holdings to cash and let the trustee make all future investment decisions.

" here's the pothole: experts are split over the viability of a plan to use private financing to fund the program to appease a deficit-averse republican congress. ""americans deserve a reliable and efficient transportation network,"" trump's transition website says. his economic advisors say the program would create about 3.3 million construction and other related jobs. and moody's analytics says it would add about 0.4 percentage points a year to economic growth. the nation needs to spend about $3.3 trillion the next decade to fix infrastructure, and there's currently a $1.4 trillion funding gap, according to the american society of civil engineers. such improvements, it says, also would add about $4 trillion to gross domestic product by enhancing productivity. yet trump's website provides no details on how to pay for the proposal. a spokeswoman for the president-elect did not respond to a request for comment. during the campaign, trump touted a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nation's frayed airports, bridges highways, ports and waterways. two of his economic advisors -- business professor peter navarro of the university of california-irvine and private equity investor wilbur ross -- laid out a blueprint to finance the spending with investor money that theoretically would add nothing to the deficit. under the plan, private firms would put up about 20% of the cost and borrow the rest. the government would provide tax credits to cover 82% of their investment. as a result, the firms would need to earn about a 10% return only on the rest of their investment not covered by the tax credits. what's more, navarro and ross contend, stronger revenue for construction firms involved in the projects and higher wages for their workers would generate enough economic activity and government tax revenue to pay for the credits -- without adding to the deficit. but where do these private investors come from? navarro and ross say some could be found among the multinationals with about $2 trillion in profits parked overseas. trump already has proposed allowing them to bring the money back to the u.s. at a discounted 10% tax. many could take part in the infrastructure program and receive credits that offset the 10% tax. michael likosky, head of the infrastructure practice for 32 advisors, believes it could all work. some of the projects could generate enough revenue through tolls on highways or bridges to net a healthy profit for investors. in other cases, he says, state or local governments could pay fees to the investors to provide a return on their money. the benefits for the government: a shorter timeline to complete the projects; a longer than usual period to pay back the money; and the ability to keep the debt off their balance sheets. others are dubious. ""our view is that this particular plan is seriously flawed,"" says paul van de water, senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities. he says many projects, such as expanding broadband to schools, would not lend themselves to tolls or other fees. and, he says, it's not clear why state or local governments would pay higher returns to private investors when they can just issue bonds at historically low interest rates. van de water is also skeptical that the additional economic activity generated by the projects can pay for the tax credits, describing the idea as ""fanciful."" it would be more practical, he says, for the government to simply borrow money for the upgrades, noting that alone would not add much to the budget deficit, which was $587 billion in fiscal 2016, down from $1.4 trillion in 2009. the bigger threat to the deficit, he says, is trump's tax cuts, which the tax policy center says  would add $6.2 trillion to the u.s. debt the next decade. and economist chris lafakis of moody's analytics says the added spending would stoke inflation and drive up interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Trump infrastructure plan hits pothole; Experts divided over investor funding for rebuilding proposal,11/16/16

" tom ford's sophomore directing effort (in theaters friday in new york and los angeles; additional cities nov. 23 and opens nationwide dec. 9), his follow-up to 2009's a single man, infuses a hitchcockian thriller with modern-day opulence, telling a story of death and heartbreak. susan (amy adams) is a wealthy (if miserable) married art gallery owner living a carefully curated life in l.a. who receives a manuscript written by her ex-husband, edward (jake gyllenhaal). she -- and the story -- soon disappear inside the book's plot, in which a fictional family experiences a brutal carjacking on the back roads of texas at the hands of a psychotic killer (aaron taylor-johnson). adams shot her designer-clad scenes in los angeles, separately from the texas carnage, with her character decked out in cartier, louis vuitton and chanel (though zero tom ford designs, as the director has taken pains to separate his fashion and movie careers). she arrived on the set after the carjacking sequence had been shot, ""and you got the sense that the crew had witnessed something. it seemed like they were survivors,"" says adams, today wearing a leather pencil skirt designed by her director and sandwiched between gyllenhaal and an immaculately dressed ford. gyllenhaal takes on dual roles,  playing susan's ex-husband in flashbacks and tony, the father in edward's novel, who numbly fails to protect his wife and daughter when faced with incredible violence (to the disgust of a laconic texas ranger, played by michael shannon). the actor says he knew he had to leave the primal instincts to taylor-johnson. ""i had just done a number of roles where i was super-physical. i played a boxer (in southpaw). i needed to shed that, just psychologically,"" gyllenhaal says.

""i was extremely insecure, and so i became obsessed with materialism,"" the writer/director says.  ""our culture teaches us that happiness is a state: once you achieve it, you're there. and you achieve it by buying that, having this, going there, marrying this person, and then you're happy. and that's actually not true."" ford says his awakening came a decade ago as he battled a drinking problem.

" was it illegal or just hilariously rude? did he or nbc break a law, or merely trash the taste test? the network declined to comment on whether chappelle's language violated internal network or show standards for late-night broadcasts. but chappelle himself seemed to sense the risk even as he was delivering his opening: he aimed an apology at snl executive producer lorne michaels, who was offstage. but the sound of gasping was not heard across the land. one local nbc affiliate, wral in raleigh, n.c., censored the show audio nine times during the broadcast, later citing chappelle's comments as justification. but even that station says it will review its standards,  according to a statement on its website sunday from general manager steve hammel. ""we apologize for impeding the full flow and message of dave chappelle's monologue. it was not our intention to censor his message,"" hammel said. ""we followed policies and procedures that have been in place for many years. ... this is an opportunity for us to review those policies and procedures."" it's not clear whether any other local affiliate did the same. after all, chappelle -- in his first-ever snl hosting appearance, and after the election last week of donald trump -- was joking about the president-elect's  casual use in 2005 of the same offensive term. news of that, caught on a hot mike, briefly upended his campaign and was the subject of countless news broadcasts and media stories last month. but the shame-on-you tweets after snl were few and far between. ""no white person could have said what #davechappelle said. especially saying (the p-word) and the #nword. shame on all of you,""  a twitter user in pittsburgh wrote. ""i'm surprised (nbc) got away with it,"" says paul porter, a former bet programming executive who now owns a radio station in orlando. he believes many americans have become inured to both words from their  use in popular culture. ""was chappelle hilarious? yes, his monologue was great, but (those words) should not have been on snl. nbc should have censored it. ... there should be a moral responsibility."" chappelle's monologue was widely praised,  seemingly by all sides. trump supporters appreciated his  ""give trump a chance"" sentiments; trump opponents thought he brilliantly nailed the  despair of the defeated. even the parents television council, a reliable critic of violence and sexual content on tv, couldn't get worked up about chappelle and snl, which airs too late for most children anyway. it's not clear whether anyone lodged an snl complaint by monday with the federal communications commission, which enforces federal law against obscenity, indecency and profanity on public airwaves. the fcc doesn't answer that kind of question without  a formal freedom of information act request, which can be a lengthy process. according to the agency's media office, what is banned on tv depends on what is said, the context and the time of day. the bottom line: the p-word may be offensive, cruel and sophomoric, but it probably not illegal, and especially not in the 11:35 p.m. time slot when snl begins. obscene content (defined by courts as appealing to prurient interest, patently offensive sexual conduct, lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value) is banned at all times. indecent content (sexual or excretory organs or activities) and profane content (grossly offensive language) is banned on broadcast tv and radio between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. (the so-called safe harbor), when children may be in the audience. ""the fcc has never said that (the p-word) is one of those words you can't say on tv, and there's fairly strong reason to believe it's not,"" says first amendment lawyer lee levine in washington. ""issues of taste and rudeness don't matter legally."" porter says existing broadcasting regulations are too broad and too hard to enforce. levine says there are real doubts that the regulations are still relevant in the era of twitter, netflix and  cable. republican administrations have typically been more interested than democratic administrations in using fcc standards as a tool to regulate language on tv, levine says.

" trump explainers say the experts missed this moment because they demanded specificity and facts from the president-elect in a way his devotees did not. ""the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally,"" salena zito wrote in the atlantic. though trump supporters might possess a remarkable capacity to suspend disbelief, the rest of the world will not be so forgiving. as the commander in chief of the armed forces and guarantor of the post-war geopolitical order, every statement out of trump's mouth will be taken quite literally by both america's allies and adversaries. the foundation of deterrence is a clear and unequivocal understanding of what interests a nation will fight to defend. vagueness in the realm of statecraft leads revisionist powers to test their parameters and, in so doing, risk overreaching and miscalculation. that's how wars start. obama's red line we don't have to go diving into the deepest recesses of history to support the contention that u.s. presidents must say what they mean and mean what they say. president obama drew a red line over the prospect of syrian president bashar assad deploying chemical weapons against civilians, but obama's bluff was called and the world saw him blink. the following years were typified by aggressive nations testing washington's commitment to defending the status quo. not since world war ii has a european power invaded and summarily annexed neighboring territory, but that's what an emboldened russian president vladimir putin did in 2014. this brazen test of the western powers that had guaranteed ukrainian territorial integrity occurred only after obama leaned on moscow to save him from himself by negotiating the surrender of assad's chemical stockpiles. in the end, assad maintained and still uses his chemical weapons. beijing, too, watched obama back off his red line. when he took office, obama dedicated himself to reorienting u.s. diplomatic and military posture toward the asia pacific. the ""pivot to asia"" seemed forever on the horizon and, by 2014, was not yet manifest in the form of appreciably more u.s. naval hardware in the region. assured of american timidity, china created territory from whole cloth in the contested south china sea, turning man-made islands into fortresses dedicated to power projection. obama was generally prudent about the language he used when he knew that the world was listening. yet the president's moment of incaution made for a more dangerous world. what will be the effect of a far less circumspect president tripping over his words on a more regular basis? trump's nato waffle trump has already given the west's adversaries cause to test him. when the new york times asked whether he'd come to the aid of estonia, latvia or lithuania in the event of a russian incursion, trump refused to say and added: ""we have many nato members that aren't paying their bills."" yet nato's mutual defense provisions require such a military response, and in any case estonia is one of five nato member states that met its 2015 requirement to spend the equivalent of 2% of gdp on defense. this is a signal to russia's expansionist president, who will surely take advantage of what he perceives to be new latitude. china is frequently the subject of trump's tough talk, but no state would so benefit from america's retreat from its financial obligations. the likely death of the 12-member trans-pacific partnership may lead to regional trade pacts that privilege chinese and japanese markets and don't impose u.s. standards on them. anticipating trump's promised ""trade war"" with china, the pacific is pivoting unto itself. trump also has said that south korea and japan might need their own nuclear weapons to protect themselves, because america can't afford it anymore. it's only smart for asia to prepare for a post-american future. in the cold, hard power logic of geopolitics, history hangs on the american president's every word. being coy or offhand about u.s. security priorities can lead to the kind of miscalculations that have the potential to devolve into cascading cycles of proportionately escalating retaliation. absent cooler heads, those cycles can spiral out of control. a president does not have the luxury of imprecise language. trump's fans may not take his words seriously, but america's enemies most certainly will. noah c",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,World will take Trump literally; President Obama has learned the hard way how much words matter,11/16/16
" we have to assume that some of donald trump's worst campaign rhetoric  on  race, gender and religion will be prominent in his policies and legislation as president. by immediately hiring stephen bannon -- someone who has thrived on right-wing conspiracy theories and hate speech -- trump has certified that the phobias he ran on are part and parcel to how he will lead. it's not our responsibility as democrats to give him the benefit of the doubt. rather, it is to prepare for the broad public effort to oppose his worst instincts. to do otherwise is to embrace acquiescence and welcome more defeats. the winning coalition for democrats, now and in the future, unites our nation's changing demographics and the needs of our working class. after years of stagnant wages and off-kilter policies benefiting the rich at the expense of everyone else, the angst amongst working folks is palpable. the xenophobic and racist tenor that has permeated our politics has far too many immigrant communities fearing for safety in the very country that prides itself on being a nation of immigrants. and the crushing burden of college debt and an abysmal job market has left a skepticism among young voters that  cannot be ignored. gaining credibility in the eyes of disaffected voters will require a complete realignment of our political infrastructure, beginning with the dnc and state parties. for too long, the democratic party has been a place where ""the powers that be"" simply stay in place, while new blood and good ideas struggled to rise up. electing new leaders such as rep. keith ellison of minnesota to take the reins as party chairman would let the american people know what we stand for. we must expand our organizing capacity and develop year-round outreach across broad facets of america, without building ethnic silos -- rather, we must work toward an inclusive approach to governance and public policy. now is not the time for incremental steps or half-measures. the american people spoke last week, and the resounding message to the democratic party was that the people want bold change. rep. raul grijalva, d-ariz",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Realign the Democratic Party,11/16/16

" ""temperament,"" for example, was on many tongues this election season after years of not being much on anyone's mind. that may be why ronald c. white's new biography of ulysses s. grant, american ulysses (random house, 667,  **** out of four)  seems especially relevant, despite its focus on the sepia-toned memory of a military leader who rose to prominence -- and then the presidency -- in the 1860s. this exhaustive book, at nearly 700 pages, portrays a deeply introspective man of ideals, a man of measured thought and careful action who found himself in the crosshairs of american history at its most crucial moment. as abraham lincoln's union-saving commanding general during the civil war, the ohioan grant, an early west point graduate, was hardly a war-whooping rouser of his troops. in fact, he first distinguished himself during the mexican-american war of 1846-48 as a quiet quartermaster, managing supply lines with discipline and dedication. historian white, we're told, spent seven years researching grant, uncovering some new correspondence, and so he emerges with a fresh interpretation of the man. he convincingly refutes the dusty conclusion that grant was, for all his wartime heroism, a drunk whose two-term presidency, from 1869 to 1877, was notable mainly for its corruption. ""to the extent grant developed his military abilities during the mexican war, he did so largely by observing the leadership of senior officers,"" white writes. ""he was impressed by (gen. zachary) taylor's dress and his approachability."" taylor's temperament, his calm in the face of danger, was a match for grant's, but there were struggles. white concludes that a period of heavy drinking at a remote posting in northern california -- during which grant felt without purpose and missed his beloved wife, julia, and their children -- led him to resign from the army in 1854, only to return to it as the civil war began. but white finds little if any evidence that grant fought alcoholism afterward, despite rumors and accusations. if anything, grant's incessant cigar-smoking was likely his chief undoing -- he died of throat cancer in 1885, and the most poignant section of the book is white's account of how grant suffered through his sickness yet worked  to complete his personal memoirs, a richly expressive chronicle (as published by mark twain) that has never been out of print. the larger point of white's book, which challenges the reader with detailed dissections of the civil war battles that grant's union army fought en route to a bitter triumph, is that grant was a noble man of vision. white believes the disputed scandals of grant's second term in office unfairly overshadow what he fought for -- the  rights of african-americans, a better policy on american indians,  effective federalism -- and against, including voter suppression and the ku klux klan",LIFE; Pg. 6D,USA TODAY,'American Ulysses' rewrites the record of a national icon; Exhaustive bio looks past the long-held myths,11/16/16

""retailers have the opportunity to give shoppers a reason to visit, come out of their busy routines and from behind their computers,"" says byron carlock, pwc's real estate leader. ""and delivering a unique offering like a modern-day twist to the traditional santa claus experience is one of those reasons."" this holiday season, kids not only can help prepare santa's sleigh before their photo op, they can give the family pet its own picture with st. nick. instead of waiting in line for hours, kids and their families can reserve an appointment with santa by clicking online. malls have been ramping up their special events over the last several years. regional shopping center operator macerich, which owns 50 centers, has hosted world cup viewing parties and experiences pegged to cultural moments like hispanic heritage month. this holiday season, macerich is producing an experience with hgtv at 15 of its malls  dubbed santa hq. kids walk into a winter wonderland where their name pops up on a ""naughty or nice o'meter."" they can take an ""elfie selfie"" in which their image is captured on a screen dancing with santa's helpers and tap into ""elf ray vision"" which, through virtual reality technology, brings animated images on a tablet to life. after that whirlwind, they take a seat on santa's lap. while santa himself is a perennial draw, such an experience gives families an extra reason to get away from the computer and out to the mall, says kurt ivey, macerich's vice president of marketing. ""online shopping is going to always be there, but so are malls in that we can provide a real experience and something that's really high-touch as well as high-tech,"" ivey says. ""that allows someone to walk away with a memory as opposed to just merchandise.'' kids aren't the only ones who get to visit with santa. many macerich malls have at least one day when families can bring their cat, dog or even pet lizard to get a picture taken with the big guy. taubman centers, which operates 23 malls in the u.s. and asia, will be hosting ""santa paws'' at 16 of its malls this holiday season. the holidays remain ""one of the key appointment times for the mall,'""  says taubman centers chief operating officer william taubman. making the holiday experience new and interesting is a key way to get families to ""think of us in a special way, not just for this one time a year, but hopefully throughout the year,"" he says. kids living in miami and tampa, where there's usually more sun than ice, can visit taubman's dolphin mall or international plaza for an experience that includes snowfall. and the international market place in waikiki, hawaii, will showcase a musical light show, with animated holiday-themed images. but a highlight for many children is likely to be santa's flight academy. from now through christmas eve, kids visiting one of a dozen taubman shopping centers, such as the one here at short hills, can get their own official flight crew badge as they help st. nick prepare for his trip. at the end of the  experience, they get to celebrate a job well done inside a 22-foot sleigh before finally going to see mr. claus. it isn't just malls. toys r us and babies r us will feature santa in 100 of their stores for the first time. the toy chain, like some of the malls, is also allowing parents to reserve a spot for their child's visit.

" despite popularizing touch screens on iphones and ipads, and the fact that windows rivals have embraced touch screen pcs for awhile, the folks at apple have resisted on the mac. they still have. on the pricey ($1,799 on up) new macbook pro laptops that i've been testing for more than a week, apple brought a fresh approach to touch computing via a high-resolution strip of virtual controls known as the touch bar that's above the traditional qwerty keyboard. i found it useful at times, but it comes at a high cost. this multitouch glass strip of shortcut keys dynamically changes depending on the app you're using. in the calendar app, for example, you can change the on-screen view by electing day, week, month or year controls on the touch bar. in photos, you can slide your finger to crop or rotate a picture and apply filters. and in messages you can easily insert emojis. sometimes the context-sensitive functionality of the touch bar adds capabilities you may be accustomed to on an ios device. take predictive text -- if you're composing an email or imessage, say, the touch bar surfaces words you may want to type next. and yes, you can still summon traditional function keys and system controls from the touch bar, for screen brightness, volume and so on, all accessible via a collapsed strip on the right side. apple is also opening up the touch bar to third-party developers, bringing the functionality to, among others, microsoft office and adobe photoshop. at this stage, though, all my touch bar usage involved apple's own apps and tools. is the touch bar worth it? though tough to quantify, i quickly came to appreciate how the touch bar might make you more productive. but you still have to weigh whether trading up for the feature is worth the splurge, what with 13-inch macbook pros with the touch bar starting at $1,799 and 15-inch versions $2,399. after all, new macbook pros without the touch bar go for $1,499, and you can still get an older model for $200 less than that. plus, handy as it is, touch bar does take a little getting used to, if only because old computing habits are hard to break. with the laptop on my, well, lap, i sometimes gazed right past the touch bar altogether and instead stared directly onto the computer screen. other times i'd  pause momentarily to consider whether i should use the touch bar to handle some task or alter my workflow. sometimes there's no touch bar alternative. when i wanted to scroll inside the safari browser, i had to stick to my tried and true method of using the trackpad, which was far easier anyway. speaking of which, the trackpads on the new macbook pros are relatively ginormous: twice as large as the prior generation on the 15-inch model and 46% on the 13-inch. apple had to consider which actions warranted touch bar controls and which didn't. in the ibooks app, you can drag your finger to quickly pore through the pages of a book, but there's no touch bar control for moving ahead or back a single page at a time. meanwhile, here are other observations on what are on balance very appealing, if expensive, macbook pros. touch id. the fingerprint sensor familiar to the iphone crowd is a welcome addition to the mac, and not only for using it to get past a lock screen. it's a handy way to authorize purchases made on the web through apple pay. the keyboard. i never fully cozied up to the ""butterfly"" style qwerty keyboard on apple's macbook notebook and was worried when i first learned that the macbook pro keyboard was based on the same technology. but the refined second-generation butterfly mechanism used here represents a marked improvement. the keys are responsive. i felt perfectly comfortable, for instance, typing this column out on the keyboard. ports as it has done so many times, apple gives and takes away. the priciest new macbook pros come with four thunderbolt 3/usb-c ports, two on each side. you can use pretty much any usb-c charger to juice up your mac, though if you try a cellphone charger as i did, it might not charge quite as fast as using the supplied usb-c power adapter, which incidentally replaces the old magsafe power adapter. and you'll need an adapter to charge an iphone. indeed, while the ports here are fast, powerful and versatile, you'll need accessory adapters for hdmi, full-sized standard usb connectors and other devices, a painful transition for some. apple has already lowered the price of some accessories. battery. i didn't do a formal test, but apple is claiming about 10 hours of battery life for wireless web usage or itunes movie playback, comparable to prior models. sound. apple says the speakers here have twice the dynamic range of earlier macbook pros. what i can say is that the speakers are loud and crisp, and the overall audio quality is excellent. portability. older macbook pros were not only expensive compared to macbook airs but  heavier. they're still not cheap, but the latest 13-inch model  weighs 3 pounds, same as the air, and is 12% thinner. the 15-inch model weighs about a pound more. that makes them easier to schlep around. the bottom line macbook pros with touch bar www.apple.com $1,799 on up pro. touch bar, touch id. fast, thin, powerful and light. retina display, superb sound. con. expensive. no sd slot",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"MacBook Pro's Touch Bar proves awkward, pricey",11/16/16

" wade ""has a long, long way to go."" after trump nominates a justice to replace the late antonin scalia, the court will remain one or two votes short of a majority to send abortion decisions back to the states, experts on both sides of the issue agree. there are several reasons: the high court does not like to overrule its own precedents, particularly those that have stood for decades and affected millions of people. when it does, it tends to do so incrementally, which could mean allowing states to impose more restrictions on abortion without eliminating the federal right entirely. then there is the issue of who sits on the court and how strongly they feel about abortion. though justice clarence thomas and whoever trump selects might be ready to jettison roe, neither chief justice john roberts nor justice samuel alito is committed to doing so. roberts, in particular, is an incrementalist who has the court's reputation as an institution to consider. for that reason, trump might need to replace two more justices to make a difference. ""there's a long road ahead and many obstacles,"" says clarke forsythe, acting president and senior counsel at americans united for life. even if the court eventually reverses itself, he says, ""the issue would go back to the states, most of whom have repealed their pre-roe prohibitions."" nancy northup, president of the center for reproductive rights, says a few states such as louisiana, mississippi and north and south dakota have abortion bans ready to implement if the supreme court acts. her group says 21 states are likely to ban abortion almost immediately, and 20 others -- including california, florida and new york -- are likely to preserve abortion rights. nine others would be ""battlegrounds."" ""we would be faced with a pretty challenging landscape,"" northup says. ""people would have to cross many state lines ... to be able to get access to safe and legal abortion."" the supreme court's 7-2 decision in roe balanced a woman's right to have an abortion against the desire of some states to protect the unborn by allowing increased levels of regulation during the last trimester of pregnancy. two decades later in planned parenthood v. casey, the court upheld that basic right but allowed more limits based on the viability of the fetus. justice samuel alito's replacement of justice sandra day o'connor led the court in 2007 to uphold a federal law banning late-term, or ""partial birth,"" abortions. after scalia's death this year, the court voted 5-3 against a texas law that imposed strict requirements on abortion clinics and doctors who perform abortions. those five justices -- anthony kennedy, ruth bader ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan -- remain on the court. to move toward a reversal of roe would require one or more of them to leave while trump is president. if the court remains closely divided but with five justices opposed to abortion, most analysts predict it will move slowly -- perhaps by upholding state restrictions greater than those allowed under casey -- before deciding whether to overturn its 1973 decision. ""you could shut down most abortion clinics without overturning roe,"" says neal devins, a law professor at william & mary law school who has written on the subject. the texas law struck down in june would have forced all but nine clinics statewide to shut their doors. james bopp, general counsel for the national right to life committee since 1978, says the past four decades have seen several occasions where it seemed federal abortion rights were at risk, only to be salvaged. the most important thing about trump's election, he says, is that hillary clinton would have nominated a sixth supreme court justice who favors abortion rights.

""if yields have finally bottomed and are headed higher during the balance of this recovery, stock investors need to consider how internal leadership may be altered,"" james paulsen, chief investment officer at wells capital management, says in a note to clients. the big rally in treasury yields since the election has changed the math on the relative attractiveness of stock dividends. all of a sudden, investors might not be pushed into owning stocks just to get dividends. meanwhile, the rally in stock prices has pushed down dividend yields, making them less lucrative relative to the risk required to collect them. the dividend yield on the spdr s&p 500 has dropped to 1.9%, down from 2.3% in february. some of the reversals to yields relative to bond yields are head-turning. the biggest drops in yields relative to treasury rates is in banks. the sector's dividend yield hit a better-than-average 2.3% prior to the election, based on the financial select spdr fund. but thanks to a big rally in bank stocks, the dividend yield of the group has declined to less than 2%. take regions financial, which was yielding a lucrative 2.9% in july when the 10-year treasury was at 1.4%. that means investors collected 1.5 percentage points more in dividends from the bank than they would have from owning 10-year government debt. but that formula has  changed, with regions yielding just 1.9% after a 34% jump in its stock price this year. that trails the yield of the 10-year. it's a similar story at fifth third. the cincinnati-based bank was paying investors 3% as a dividend yield in july, but that has since fallen to 2.1%. banks are the best example of the eroding lure of dividends but not the only ones. netapp, a computer storage maker, has seen its yield drop to 2.1% as the stock jumped 31% this year. that's a change from just a few months ago, when investors were getting a 2.9% yield on the stock. some investors may decide the possible stock market gains of dividend paying stocks are still worth the extra risk",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Investors might find bonds more attractive; Stock dividends are losing sway after rally in Treasury yields,11/17/16

" cit bank, its parent company, cit group, and its onewest bank predecessor discriminated in mortgage lending, decisions on branch locations and closings and other financial actions, according to the complaint filed wednesday with the u.s. department of housing and urban development by groups that advocate for fair housing and equal access to credit. just two african-american borrowers received mortgages originated by onewest during 2014-15 in the bank's service area across los angeles and orange counties, the california reinvestment coalition and fair housing advocates of northern california charged. the low number of mortgage loans to minority borrowers and other practices violated the u.s. fair housing act, the groups alleged. mnuchin, a former goldman sachs partner who's now ceo of private hedge fund sponsor dune capital management lp, is a member of cit group's board of directors. he headed fundraising for trump's election victory over democrat hillary clinton and now is viewed as a potential pick for treasury secretary. ""our analysis of onewest suggests the bank has no significant branch presence in communities of color, and not surprisingly, its home loans to borrowers and communities of color are low in absolute terms, low compared to its peer banks and low when compared to what one would expect given the size of the asian-american, african-american and latino populations in california,"" said kevin stein, the california reinvestment coalition's executive director. the study also showed that most onewest-owned foreclosed homes in minority communities looked abandoned, while those in white communities were well-maintained, said caroline peattie, executive director of fair housing advocates of northern california. the complaint filed with hud alleged that onewest's branch location decisions ""appear to avoid communities of color."" for instance, the bank had 52 los angeles branches in all, but none in either asian-majority or african-american-majority tracts, and eight in hispanic majority tracts, the study showed. african americans account for 6.2% of los angeles' total population but received 1.7% of the mortgages onewest originated in 2015, the analysis found. if hud accepts the complaint, investigates and substantiates the alleged fair housing act violations, the bank could be charged with a civil complaint in either federal court or by an administrative law judge who works for the agency. separately, the california reinvestment coalition and other groups previously urged federal regulators to investigate disproportionately high rates of onewest foreclosures in minority communities. onewest, now cit bank, grew from the wreckage of california-based indymac bank, one of the largest bank collapses during the national financial crisis. mnuchin led an investor group that bought indymac from the federal deposit insurance corporation in early 2009 for roughly $1.55 billion. the investment group was backed by hedge fund manager john paulson, computer manufacturer michael dell, international business magnate george soros, private equity investor christopher flowers and others",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Bank tied to Trump aide accused of bias; Very few minorities received mortgages, complaint alleges",11/17/16

" is this deal legitimate? are you browsing a website with solid online security? or could you even be looking at a fake app? ""card fraud is a huge business,"" said al pascual, research director and head of fraud and security for javelin strategy and research in pleasanton, calif. ""they're going to get the data any way they can get it."" criminals are going after the databases of online merchants and trying to engineer an account takeover, pascual said. the crooks don't need to steal your credit card or debit card number, he said. instead, they use information found elsewhere, maybe via a breach, to gain access to your online account with a given retailer. once they're in, crooks could get access to the credit card you had stored with the online retailer. they might order something online and pick it up in the store. criminals know many people re-use passwords, so they can hack into accounts using passwords obtained via other breaches. ""it's just a matter of the odds, at least some of them are going to hit,"" pascual said. ""they didn't have to go into the dark web and buy the card numbers."" what are some ways to steer clear of the fraudsters this holiday season? 1.watch how you celebrate the holidays via facebook or twitter. it sounds odd. but, seriously, hackers can use social media profiles to figure out passwords, according to the american bankers association. do you need to post the dog's name with his or her holiday photo? or post a family portrait that's taken in front of your house with the address right there for everyone to see? 2.don't let fake retail apps trick you. industry experts are warning of apps that impersonate well-known retailers, such as payless shoesource, torrid and dillard's. after media reports, many fake apps have been quickly taken down by apple. but experts say it's sort of like the game whack-a-mole. one fake app is taken down, another one crops up. chris mason, president, ceo and co-founder of branding brand in pittsburgh, said con artists may use apps to install malware or trick you into providing personal information, maybe when you think you're opening up a credit card account with that retailer. some clues to a fake app: does the app have any reviews? if there are no reviews, that's a red flag, mason said. are any words misspelled in the description of the app? ""they'll misspell words like sneaker, if it's supposed to be the app for the finish line,"" mason said. 3.watch your statements. go online and check your credit card activity even more frequently during the holidays, said bill hardekopf, ceo of lowcards.com. ""don't wait for your statement at the end of the month,"" hardekopf said. fraudsters can get ahold of credit card information, even if you don't shop online, so keep an eye out for possible problems. once you report the loss or theft, the federal trade commission notes that the law says you have no additional responsibility for charges you didn't make. your liability for each credit card lost or stolen is limited to $50 in the event of fraud, but a number of card issuers have zero liability policies. to avoid possible problems, you want to alert your card holder quickly once you spot trouble. if you suspect the credit card was used fraudulently, you may have to sign a statement under oath that you didn't make the purchases. 4.take care so the box arrives -- and isn't stolen. unfortunately, the holidays are filled with stories of packages snatched off porches. crooks aren't always high-tech. so it's good to know whether your friend or family member will be home or away for the holidays. is there a way to alert them that a package will be arriving? shippers and retailers often let you track your package and notify you of delivery. 5.hit the yoga mat to calm down before spinning into an online shopping frenzy. every great deal you spot online or via a text or email is not a bargain. instead, you could be looking at a phishing expedition.

" as iraqi forces, with u.s. support, close in on mosul, the toughest fighting likely will not be in the streets or door-to-door, but in sophisticated miles-long tunnel networks isil has constructed under the city. fighting in this subterranean domain presents unique tactical, operational, technological and even legal challenges, for which the u.s. military must be better prepared. this is far from the first time tunnels have been used by asymmetric and conventional adversaries, and it is unlikely to be the last. tunnel warfare was a crucial part of the vietnam war, with north vietnamese forces burrowing underground to transport supplies and launch surprise attacks. since then, tunneling has become more high tech. as former commanders of u.s. forces in iraq and south korea, we saw modern tunneling firsthand. the north koreans have dug thousands of storage facilities to evade u.s. and south korean surveillance. in the past, the north koreans have also burrowed under the demilitarized zone in an attempt to enable surprise attacks on south korean and u.s. forces stationed there. hamas and israel just how effectively tunnels can be used in combat, and how difficult they can be to defeat, became clear in the 2014 conflict between hamas and israel. our appreciation for the threat was heightened by  trips organized by the jewish institute for national security of america, in which we visited some of these tunnels and the commanders whose units fought in and around them. hamas dug numerous ""terror tunnels"" beneath gaza and under the border into israel. these were  sophisticated engineering feats, reinforced with concrete and outfitted with power and communications systems. some were used for command, control and storing large amounts of weapons and munitions. some were used to flank israeli forces, redefining the concept of the front line. still others were used in attempts to kidnap civilians. these tunnels complicated efforts to target and destroy hamas' rocket and mortar arsenals that threatened israeli civilians. they also distracted israeli commanders by substantially increasing the risk of surprise attacks. israel struggled to counter these threats. aerial reconnaissance and airstrikes were ineffective without technology to map the tunnels' many branches and exit points.  moreover, many were built directly under heavily populated areas. by complicating israel's concerted efforts to minimize collateral damage, hamas exploited civilian casualties to delegitimize israel's campaign. taking the fight to isil israel's experiences will provide crucial guidance as america supports iraqi forces in liberating mosul. isil has controlled the city for more than two years -- ample time to prepare for this battle. coalition forces have already found tunnels in many villages they have cleared on the road to mosul and elsewhere in iraq. similar to hamas, isil has also been attempting to hide behind civilians to further neutralize the coalition's ability to target the terrorists from the air. given the importance of not just defeating isil but also winning the hearts and minds of mosul's sunni majority -- convincing them they will be kept safe by iraq's shiite-led central government -- u.s. military planners almost certainly will exercise caution in using air power against suspected tunnels. that places the onus on intelligence and surveillance capabilities, whether human or technological, to find the tunnels, and it means an even bigger burden on the troops who will have to clear and destroy them. taking the fight to isil beneath mosul will not be the job of the u.s. advisers supporting iraqi troops. but this task very well could fall to american servicemembers in future possible conflicts against conventional or asymmetric opponents. two army reports in the past two years have warned that u.s. forces are unprepared to operate in the complex sprawl of modern megacities. therefore, it is critical to incorporate lessons from subterranean campaigns such as gaza and mosul into our own military planning and combat training centers. cooperating with allies facing similar threats, like israel, should be an important part in determining the best tactics, techniques and procedures now and in the future. we must also invest in new technologies to detect, defeat and destroy tunnels. our air force owns the skies, our navy, the seas. our army and marine corps must be prepared to own not just the ground, but also the tunnels beneath it",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"War in the tunnels under Mosul; Our forces need to prepare for battle by air, sea, land and now beneath megacities",11/17/16
"w. bush -- neither his supporters nor his opponents seem very upset. studies show that most presidential candidates have honored most of their campaign promises. once elected, however, everyone compromises, backtracks or fudges to some extent. trump will be no exception, judging from his comments during the past week. he's said he wouldn't necessarily build a wall along every inch of the mexican border; would focus deportation efforts not on all undocumented immigrants but on those with criminal records; and try to retain some redeeming facets of obamacare. for a variety of reasons -- including his supporters' love of him, his opponents' hatred of his proposals and a general acknowledgment that trump is best taken seriously but not literally -- this president may prove more immune than most to the political cost of broken promises. john mcglennon, who teaches government at the college of william & mary, says, ""both sides are willing to give him more flexibility than a conventional candidate would be allowed."" more, certainly, than the 41st president got. bush failed to win re-election in 1992 after campaigning in 1988 on a promise -- ""read my lips: no new taxes!'' -- he later broke. possibly because few major presidential candidates have made such drastic proposals, many trump opponents are relieved he apparently won't try to do everything he said he'd do. many trump supporters say they never really expected him to do everything he said he'd do. first, some trump opponents: ""i prayed that he would have a change of heart, that he'd realize that some things he said he'd do he cannot do,"" such as vaporize the affordable care act, says angelina iles, a retired school employee who lives in pineville, la. and voted for hillary clinton. david bugh of lancaster, ohio, a pastor and small business owner, says he was afraid after trump passed 270 electoral votes. given signs of what he calls trump's ""moderation,"" he says, ""i'm a little less pessimistic now."" even a die-hard never-trumper such as democrat rich langan of ashwaubenon, wis., a retired police officer, says he's trying to keep an open mind: ""i'll give him six months."" as for the trump supporters: despite some fiery campaign rhetoric, ""once he's in office, he'll soften up on pretty much everything,"" says barry fixler, who opened his own trump headquarters in bardonia, n.y. that's fine with fixler, a jeweler. ""in his heart, trump loves people. he won't do anything to drastically affect people,"" such as non-criminal undocumented immigrants. ""he's not going to throw out children. he's just going after the criminals and isis.'' many trump voters say their man's opponents were spooked by his campaign promises because they didn't understand how he works. gene dunn is a longtime trump admirer who took his son out of school to attend trump's presidential campaign announcement at trump tower. trump's campaign promises were ""standard the art of the deal practice,"" he says, referring to trump's 1987 best seller. ""asking for the whole enchilada, but settling for what's reasonable. and all sides can claim victory."" a.d. amar, an indian immigrant and business professor who lives in warren, n.j., agrees that many of trump's promises were really opening gambits: ""that is trump's style as a negotiator. he throws the extreme negative outcome at his opponents. this brings them to the table, and then whatever they get after the negotiation is better than what trump originally threw at them."" here's how president-elect trump has been rewriting candidate trump: some elements of the affordable care act, which he'd promised to repeal and replace, are worth keeping. he cited provisions requiring coverage of pre-existing medical conditions and allowing children to remain on parents' plans until they turn 26. ""i like those very much,"" trump told the wall street journal. some undocumented immigrants are ""terrific people,"" and his priorities are 1) securing the border and 2) deporting criminals. the number of undocumented immigrants is about 11million; criminals in that group number anywhere from 800,000 to several million. some sections of the ""big beautiful wall"" he's vowed to build along the border might actually look more like fencing. if and when americans try to pin candidate trump's promises to president trump, they will have their work cut out for them, says john baick, who teaches american political history at western new england university in springfield, mass. one problem is  volume -- the ""many, many promises made on the campaign trail,"" baick says. ""there is almost certainly no candidate who has produced more verbiage, in person and in digital form, than donald trump."" another is the lack of specifics. trump, baick says, ""can claim that he has kept many simply by taking symbolic steps."" it may be enough if trump starts to build the wall, just as john f. kennedy gets credit for starting a man-on-the-moon program not scheduled for completion until after what would have been his second term. trump may already have kept his biggest, most emotional promise to supporters, mcglennon says: ""as long as they feel he'll bring an end to business as usual in washington, they'll worry about the details later on.'' but there will be a later on. mcglennon says that although there's merit to the idea that trump spoke to his supporters in ways that should not be taken literally, ""the question is how long the public will be satisfied with that",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"Promises, promises, promises",11/18/16

" but there's never been one quite like uptown funk. the singer's throwback jam with mark ronson spent 14 consecutive weeks atop the billboard hot 100 singles chart last year, and last week, it became the 13th song in history to be certified diamond by the riaa. at one point, uptown was raking in $100,000 a week for ronson and co. through spotify streams alone -- unsurprising, given all the wedding, bar mitzvah and block party playlists it's cropped up on. it makes sense that mars would try to harness that same energy on his third studio album, 24k magic (out friday, **1/2 out of four), a sleek, chest-puffing call to the dance floor that aspires to be nothing more than a feel-good friday night soundtrack. it's a natural evolution for the grammy-winning showman, who broke big as a reggae-tinged motown crooner on his 2010 debut doo-wops & hooligans, before transitioning to bawdier, jauntier fare on 2012's unorthodox jukebox. here, mars channels '80s and '90s r&b stars prince, boyz ii men and babyface (who co-wrote album closer too good to say goodbye) with aplomb, riding a cool wave of synthesizers and drum machines as he bounces between the club and bedroom. ""if you ain't here to party, take your (expletive) back home,"" he demands on chunky, before hosting an all-out ""booty celebration"" on the unabashedly cheesy straight up & down. throughout 24k's tightly-packaged nine tracks, mars never passes up an opportunity to flaunt his wealth or ability to woo women, which he makes clear from the get-go on the album's shimmering title track. a spiritual sequel to uptown, 24k magic establishes mars as a ""dangerous man with money in my pocket"" over an indelible disco-funk beat. though that's what i like takes his hedonism to borderline obnoxious levels, he wisely scales back the braggadocio on the schmaltzy versace on the floor and calling all my lovelies. the latter is a cheeky take on a heartbreak song, as he rebukes a lover for not returning his calls. (""i got too many on my team for you to act so mean / i got alicia waiting, aisha waiting, all the 'ishas waiting on me."") 24k is mars' most polished album and a laudable step forward for his longtime producing team, the smeezingtons (consisting of him, philip lawrence and ari levine). but unlike the classic r&b he strives to emulate, it's oddly aloof. mars too often relies on clichí©d lyrics and phoned-in vocals, and he shies away from the vulnerability that endeared him to fans on ballads grenade and when i was your man",LIFE; Pg. 2D,USA TODAY,Bruno Mars makes 'Magic' on R&B jam third album,11/18/16
" ""no, has it really been four years?"" mars, 31, asks between drags of a cigarette as he hunches on a couch in atlantic records' midtown office. his grammy-winning sophomore effort unorthodox jukebox was released in december 2012, and his latest, 24k magic, is out friday,  two weeks shy of the  anniversary. whatever the time frame, ""y'all just being dramatic!"" he laughs, putting on a dramatic voice. ""it's been 44 years since bruno was seen ..."" not that he's been mia. in addition to scoring three top-5 singles off unorthodox and touring the globe on a nearly sold-out arena trek, the affable singer headlined the 2014 super bowl halftime show with the red hot chili peppers and emerged at this year's halftime show to perform a little song called uptown funk. uptown, mars' collaboration with mark ronson, has been the biggest hit of their careers so far:  it spent 14 weeks at no. 1 on the billboard hot 100 singles chart and earned a grammy award for record of the year. neither could have predicted the magnitude of the song's success when they co-wrote it in 2014. the euphoria of uptown clearly rubbed off on 24k, a nostalgia-fueled joyride that puts a glistening pop sheen on old-school r&b from the late 1980s and '90s. writing the album, mars and his producing team the smeezingtons (philip lawrence and ari levine) were inspired by artists they grew up listening to, including jimmy jam and terry lewis, babyface and teddy riley (of blackstreet and guy). mars starts the party right out of the gate on the glitzy title track, which debuted at no. 5 on the billboard hot 100 singles chart last month and has since tallied 95 million spotify streams, 124 million youtube views and 349,000 downloads, according to nielsen music. the bumptious behemoth -- with its references to ""cuban links"" and ""designer minks"" -- was recorded with extravagance that seems uncharacteristic of mars, who is mellow and meditative as he discusses the new music. ""this whole album, we be walking into the studio just wearing some fabulous (stuff), wearing pinky rings, and that kind of set the tone,"" mars says. ""to have the audacity to sing (lyrics) like, 'i'm calling all my lovelies 'cuz i can't get a hold of you,' like, who do you think you are that you can say that?"" despite his success, mars doesn't appear to have an inflated ego. for instance, after he wrote all i ask with adele off her blockbuster 25, the british diva told vogue that he will be the ""biggest artist in the world."" he sheepishly demurs, ""while she sells 30 million albums. she's a sweetheart."" as he gears up for another world tour, which lands stateside next summer, mars says he doesn't have any lofty goals for his 24k magic era. rather, ""i just want to make sure i put out the best that i could do",LIFE; Pg. 1D,USA TODAY,Bruno Mars funks it up on retro '24K Magic'; New R&B album comes four years after his smash 'Uptown Funk',11/18/16

" watchdogs argued that the rule ignores the biggest ethics challenge his new administration faces: the towering financial conflicts of interest posed by trump's own far-flung business holdings. lobbyists said trump's post-employment lobbying ban could cripple his ability to fill thousands of open jobs in the federal government trump's lobbying restrictions, announced late wednesday, require incoming officials to end their lobbying activity and pledge not to lobby for five years after they leave the government. in a conference call thursday with reporters, transition spokesman sean spicer called the requirement a ""forward-thinking change"" that would help ensure that new hires value ""service to the nation"" ahead of personal enrichment. the announcement of the lobbying ban builds on a trump campaign pledge to ""drain the swamp"" in washington and came after days of upheaval and staff changes for the transition team, which must quickly recruit, vet and hire about 4,000 political appointees. this week, vice president-elect mike pence, who recently replaced new jersey gov. chris christie as transition chairman, began expelling lobbyists brought into the transition during christie's tenure. under the new lobbying rules, those joining the administration must certify that they are not registered to lobby. if they lobbied recently, they must provide proof that they have terminated their registration. paul miller, a small-business lobbyist in washington who is president of the national institute for lobbying and ethics, said the ban unfairly tars his industry and will ""have a chilling effect on somebody who wants to work for the government."" ""this election wasn't about draining the swamp,"" he said. ""it was about voter disappointment with gridlock in washington. if (politicians) don't like us, they should stop asking us for campaign money."" former members of congress face far shorter limits on lobbying their former colleagues than the people who will work in the trump administration. ex-house members face a one-year ban on post-employment lobbying of congress; former senators cannot lobby capitol hill for two years after they depart. miller predicted that trump's hires will get around the tough five-year ban by masking themselves as consultants once they leave the government. ""you are just going to create a secret society of people not registering"" as lobbyists, he said. trump's post-employment rules for lobbyists are tougher than president obama's, which banned former federal officials from lobbying their former agency colleagues for two years after leaving the government. michael toner, who served as the top lawyer in president george w. bush's transition to the white house, said a five-year ban was unprecedented. trump's rule veers from obama's approach in another way. the outgoing president barred most lobbyists coming into his administration from working on issues on which they had lobbied during the previous two years, although the white house has granted waivers to that rule. trump doesn't impose any ""look-back"" restrictions, toner said, so ""people aren't going to be fenced out because they were lobbyists last year or last week."" lisa gilbert of the liberal-leaning public citizen watchdog group said trump's five-year ban on post-employment lobbying is ""constructive."" but she said it does little to quell other pressing concerns, particularly about the incoming president's ties to his real estate empire. rather than placing his assets in a strict blind trust, trump will have his three oldest children, donald jr., ivanka and eric trump, run the trump organization. all three also serve on his transition team, along with trump son-in-law jared kushner, a real estate developer and newspaper publisher. ""if he really wants to get serious about draining the swamp, we expect him to deal with his own profound conflicts,"" gilbert said in an interview thursday. public citizen and more than a dozen other groups and ethics lawyers issued a public letter to trump on thursday, calling on him to either place all his business assets into a true blind trust or convert his holdings to cash and invest the money in treasury bills and diversified mutual funds. norm eisen, who served as obama's ethics lawyer in the white house, was among those who signed thursday's letter. in an interview, he called trump's new lobbying rules ""a good first step"" but said the president-in-waiting needs to address other issues, including his own business interests and the potential financial conflicts of non-lobbyists who will work in his administration. during christie's tenure running the transition, eisen and other campaign-finance watchdogs had been in discussions with transition officials over a possible executive order governing ethics in the new administration. he said the fate of that proposal was unclear thursday, but he stands ready to work with trump's team on a plan to address broader ethics concerns. at least one lobbyist seems to have taken steps to join the new administration. josh pitcock, a pence aide who lobbied for indiana, filed senate paperwork this week to end his status as a federal lobbyist",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Lobbyists warn ban will have 'chilling effect'; Watchdogs point to Trump's corporate conflicts of interest,11/18/16

"usually they wait until they take office to publicly change their minds. within days of winning the election, president-elect donald trump has backpedaled on some core domestic positions to a degree that may be unprecedented, according to historians.""i've never seen anything quite like this: so quickly backtracking on the signature issues on which he ran,"" said allan lichtman, the presidential historian at american university who forecast trump's victory over hillary clinton.""nothing comes to mind of a president-elect beginning to issue a series of, if not retractions, modifications, so rapidly,"" said bruce buchanan, a university of texas historian who's written several books on the presidency.trump's policy shifts offer signs as to how he may govern as the most unpredictable candidate in recent history to arrive at 1600 pennsylvania ave. the real estate billionaire ran a campaign largely on personality -- casting himself as the populist hero of a forgotten working class, even breaking with party orthodoxy in pledging to reject social security cuts that his party insists are necessary to preserve the program.  trump will lean heavily on the same establishment republican leadership he disparaged to craft his domestic agenda. ""i wouldn't be surprised to see lots of rewriting of trump proposals with congressional input,"" buchanan said.during the campaign, many of trump's advisers were ""not aware of how to frame legislation and what's possible and what's not,"" buchanan said. ""we're still in the blush of the honeymoon stage and will be for a while. but a lot of the stuff he talked about isn't going to happen."" domestic policies protecting the safety net congressional republicans led by house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., have long wanted to rewrite social safety net programs. that would result in cuts to programs such as social security and medicare, which account for at least half of the federal budget, that trump's working-class voters disproportionately rely on.  although trump vowed not to cut medicare or medicaid, according to his transition website, he wants to ""modernize medicare,"" borrowing language republicans have long used. it's difficult to know what the trump administration will do. unlike presidential teams before them, trump's people have held no news conferences since the election to clarify their plans. among items he campaigned on missing from his website is his vow to allow americans to import prescription drugs from other countries where they're sold at lower prices. investigations trump vowed to appoint a special prosecutor ""immediately, immediately, immediately"" to investigate hillary clinton, even saying during a debate that if he was elected, clinton would be ""in jail."" as a result, the democratic nominee was taunted by protesters wielding ""lock her up"" signs -- though she was cleared by the fbi of any criminal charges related to her email server. in his first television interview after the election, trump seemed to reject the idea of a special prosecutor and sounded like the trump of five years ago, when he praised the clintons as a great family. ""i don't want to hurt them, i don't want to hurt them,"" trump told cbs news. immigration trump has refused to answer questions about his proposed muslim ban -- it is not listed on his website under the immigration tab -- and it's unclear how his deportation policy would differ from current law. in the cbs interview, trump said he wants to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants who are ""gang members, drug dealers"" or have other criminal convictions. the migration policy institute estimates there are roughly 11million immigrants in the usa illegally and 820,000 of them have criminal records. trump's policy is in line with orders obama gave when he first took office to prioritize deportation of immigrants with criminal convictions, which led to a record number of deportations. repealing obamacare on the stump, trump made repealing and replacing the ""disaster"" of obamacare a key talking point, warning it will ""destroy american health care forever."" as president-elect, trump told the wall street journal he was reconsidering his stance after a meeting with obama, who urged him to protect parts of the law. trump said he would like to keep the provisions forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and allowing young americans to remain on their parents' health care plans. ""either obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,"" he told the journal. coal jobs trump promised  during his campaign to bring back coal jobs, calling himself the ""last shot for the miners"" and vowing to undo  clean energy regulations. it was a winning  argument for miners who cited clinton's comments that she would put the coal industry out of business. she later apologized.  republicans say it's not the government's role to bring back the jobs as companies invest in other forms of energy. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,Keeping track of Trump's promises,11/18/16
" yellen also said trump's victory has not altered fed plans to raise interest rates next month, though his economic policies eventually could force the central bank to reassess its outlook. ""the economy is operating relatively close to full employment at this point,"" yellen told the joint economic committee. as a result, massive government outlays would drive up inflation as employers bid up wages to attract a limited pool of workers. by contrast, she said, the economy needed a jolt to anemic demand after the 2008 financial crisis. said yellen: ""the long-run deficit probably needs to be kept in mind."" the national debt, she noted, is about 77% of gross domestic product, adding, ""there's not a lot of fiscal space should a shock to the economy occur."" yellen said she was not passing judgment on trump's plan to spend $550 billion to upgrade the nation's crumbling infrastructure, boost defense spending and cut taxes sharply. that, she said, is congress' role. in the past, yellen has urged congress to pass fiscal stimulus to take the burden of goosing a sluggish economy off the fed alone. her remarks  thursday, however, reflect a new landscape now that the unemployment rate is at a near-normal 4.9%, down from 10% in 2009. ""to my mind, the evidence we've seen since (the fed's early november meeting) reinforces our judgment"" that the federal funds rate should go up soon. ""when there is greater clarity about"" trump's economic policies, the fed will ""perhaps adjust our outlook."" after trump's win, some economists suggested the fed would delay a december rate increase, contending the republican's trade and immigration policies would slow growth. but  others have said his ambitious plans to upgrade roads, bridges and waterways will stoke the economy and inflation in the near-term, requiring faster rate hikes. trump's proposed massive tax cuts also could widen the deficit and fuel inflation and higher rates. in her prepared testimony, however, yellen said policymakers continue to expect the pace of growth ""will warrant only gradual increases"" in its key rate, noting the economy is still set to expand slowly by historical standards. she cited low productivity growth, saying congress should consider policies to bolster ""long-run growth and productivity."" that suggests policies that improve workers skills, for example, are more critical to the economy's long-term health than short-term stimulus measures. yellen said putting off a rate increase could lead to more abrupt hikes down the road. the fed has held its federal funds rate steady since raising it in december for the first time in nine years. yellen reiterated the language in the fed's post-meeting statement this month, which said the case for a rate increase had continued to strengthen and the fed would act as long as it received ""some further evidence of continued progress"" toward its goals. she said fed policymakers expected to lift rates ""relatively soon."" in september, yellen said discouraged workers on the sidelines were being drawn into an improving labor market, keeping the unemployment rate from falling and tempering wage growth and inflation. she said the fed wanted to encourage that trend by holding off on a rate increase a bit longer. in her testimony, she said there still ""appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market"" that eventually will spur faster pay gains. ""indeed, there are some signs the pace of wage growth has stepped up recently,"" yellen said. annual pay increases reached a seven-year high of 2.8% last month. yellen also said she opposes proposals that would lift the dodd-frank financial reform's constraints on large banks. trump has called for repealing the legislation. in september, trump contended yellen was keeping interest rates low to help president obama, stoking a stock market bubble. yellen simply responded that the fed steers clear of politics",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Yellen: Trump plan may feed inflation; But Fed chair says interest rate hike on track for December,11/18/16

" only 10% of those addicted receive treatment, the study said. ""facing addiction in america: the surgeon general's report on alcohol, drugs and health"" marks the first report from a surgeon general dedicated to substance addiction, raising the profile of the epidemic and advocating proven treatment options. an american dies every 19minutes from opioid or heroin overdose, and thursday's report spells out the cost of substance abuse. the economic impact of drug and alcohol misuse and addiction amounts to $442 billion each year -- topping diabetes at $245 billion, said vivek murthy, the surgeon general. ""at a time when we are resource-constrained already, we cannot afford, for humanitarian reasons or financial reasons, to not address addiction in america,"" murthy said in an interview with usa today. every $1 invested in viable treatment options for substance use disorders saves $4 in health care costs and $7 in criminal justice costs, murthy said. that's one reason why the report advocates for a paradigm shift on addiction that removes the stigma from addiction, creating more patients and fewer prisoners. ""we have to recognize (addiction) isn't evidence of a character flaw or a moral failing,"" murthy said. ""it's a chronic disease of the brain that deserves the same compassion that any other chronic illness does, like diabetes or heart disease."" bryon adinoff, an addiction psychiatrist at the university of texas southwestern medical center, said the report's influence carries hope that how americans see and understand addiction might change. genetics account for about half of a person's likelihood of becoming addicted, adinoff said, but viewing addiction first and foremost as an illness clashes with americans' up-by-your-bootstraps mentality. ""our whole approach to substance abuse disorders is they're illegal and you go to jail,"" he said. ""it's the only illness for which you send people to jail, for long, long periods of time."" nearly 21 million americans struggle with substance addictions, according to the report. that's more than the number of people who have all cancers combined. that only one in 10 people with substance addictions receive treatment points to the significant holes in america's health care system. high costs, a lack of screening for addictions and a fragmentation of health care services worsen the problem, according to the report. one bright spot for those seeking treatment has been the affordable care act, or obamacare, murthy said, which made 20 million people eligible to receive health insurance. the law, along with the mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008, increased access to addiction treatment services. in the wake of last week's election, the affordable care act could be overhauled. whatever happens over the next four to eight years, murthy said, continuing to expand coverage will remain key to addressing addiction. linda rosenberg, president of the national council for behavioral health, agreed. those in the throes of addiction are often young and uninsured, she said. she praised the report as a call to action, not only for organizations such as hers that work with treatment centers but also for the incoming presidential administration. ""that includes fighting to keep the medicaid expansion,"" rosenberg said. ""i don't care whether you rename it 'trumpcare,' i just want people to be able to get services.""

" but given the staggering disconnect that has been highlighted by the recent election results between the tech community and a large portion of the u.s. population, it's not unrealistic to think the changes could be profound. at a simple level, there already are signs the business climate is moving into a more conservative phase with a focus on basic types of developments. all the discussion about infrastructure improvements, for example, clearly highlights the areas that are going to receive attention from the new administration. wall street and many observers have interpreted this to mean that industries such as construction, steel and heavy equipment are the likely beneficiaries of this shift in investment priorities. while that no doubt is true, there also are potentially interesting pockets of opportunities for tech companies -- if they're focused in the right areas. smart city applications one obvious example is the technologies being built for smart city applications. while i freely admit to having been a skeptic about the potential for some of the more grandiose smart city visions that a few tech companies have touted, there's one incredible truism for most all internet of things (iot) applications: it's much easier to integrate technology into something being built than it is to add it on after the fact. in other words, if we do start to see a great deal of construction and other infrastructure projects being funded, that could be a great opportunity to embed the necessary ""intelligent"" components into these projects. it would certainly be a lot easier to do that than to retrofit some of these technologies into existing infrastructure. the problem is the cost rationales and benefit discussions for adding these tech elements are going to have to be a lot more concrete and specific than most of the vague ""we'll sell it as a service"" business models that currently infiltrate many iot initiatives. while there are certainly situations where building a business that depends on continuous service payments makes sense, an infrastructure project that is meant to be around for decades isn't one of those situations. the problems with saas plus, the truth is, many of the ""software as a service"" business models often are created to hide weak fundamental value for a product or service. if companies can't figure out how to get prospective customers to pay for something outright, they often obfuscate the situation by creating business models that are built on never-ending ongoing payments for a ""service."" in the more conservative business environment it appears we're headed into, i have a feeling these ""as a service"" models aren't likely to survive. i just don't see most people being willing to accept the idea that nearly everything will come as a pay-as-you go service -- especially the use of public infrastructure. (witness the challenges public toll road companies have been having.) similarly, the soul-searching many in tech are now doing is bound to challenge expectations about what types of areas are worthy of more investment. even with record amounts of capital available for vcs to invest, it's not clear that smartphone-driven dog-walking services or revenue-free, gif-meme-generating companies are the best options. the election results make clear that way too much time and money has been, and continues to be, spent on products and services that really only appeal to and benefit a small fraction of the population. moving forward, focusing on developments that have clear-cut advantages for people and industries outside the tech circle would seem to make a lot of sense. from manufacturing and robotics to agriculture and health care, there are a huge range of industries that could potentially benefit from the kinds of technologies and innovations that the tech industry can create. they may not be as sexy or exciting as what many tech companies and investors have focused on until now, but the potential impact could be much broader. in the end, no one knows for sure which new opportunities will thrive in what is bound to be a very different business and investment climate. what seems clear, however, is that the halcyon days of the tech industry being able to foist some, frankly, pretty questionable business ideas onto an audience of little more than its own friends and family, are likely over. usa today columnist bob o'donnell is the president and chief analyst of technalysis research, a market research and consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"Trump election likely to drive new PRIORITIES IN TECH INVESTMENT; As business climate begins moving into a more conser- vative stage, think smart cities and industrial applications",11/18/16

""they go for clarity and curation; they need someone to distill the abundance of information available to them. ""what stresses people today,"" he says, ""isn't the lack of information. ... it's not knowing if they are asking the right questions."" the travel and hospitality marketing firm mmgy found that in 2015, 18% of travelers worked with an adviser, a 50% jump from the previous year. based on a survey of 14,000 households, the american society of travel agents reports the highest numbers in three years for consumers booking through travel agents. much of the new business comes from that most sought-after of demographics: millennials. mmgy  found that 34% of the millennials responding had consulted a traditional travel agent in the 12 months preceding the survey -- higher than any other age group. yes, the perpetually plugged-in generation, which  also is the most committed to travel, is willing to give up a little control for good advice, fewer hassles and interaction with a human. the organization found that 22% of americans making $50,000 or more booked travel through an agent in 2015. ""travel agent users tend to have more travel budget,"" says kevin wang, director of research and industry affairs for the travel agents' organization.

"k. rowling can tell them. the movies inspired by her harry potter novels, while eye-catching and well-acted, have never clarified confusing characters, riddles and time-travel as well as rowling's books have. after all, the films are adaptations of novels hundreds of pages long, trimmed to fit a feature-length film. but the new fantastic beasts and where to find them book (arthur a. levine, 280, *** out of four), the potter prequel set in the 1920s, skips the whole cutting-the-story-down step. this is the screenplay -- rowling's first -- for the movie that's out now. it's a breezy read (screenplays have many page breaks) that film fans will appreciate as a companion to the movie. (before it was a movie and a screenplay, fantastic beasts originally was a best-selling book released in 2001 and written by newt scamander, aka rowling.) fantastic beasts follows newt, a well-meaning british magizoologist who brings his case of magical creatures to new york. after he bumps into jacob, a no-maj (the american word for ""muggle""), newt accidentally lets some of his animals escape. these fantastic animals, including the thunderbird, ""a creature like a large albatross, its glorious wings shimmering with cloud- and sun-like patterns,"" are the best part of the story. as jacob says in the screenplay and in the movie which barely changes a thing from its source material, ""i ain't got the brains to make this up."" only rowling does. by inadvertently releasing his creatures, newt has committed a crime, and a former investigator from the magical congress of the united states of america, tina goldstein, wants to turn him in to authorities. while that's happening, and newt desperately tries to find his animals, there's something else at play: anti-wizard sentiment is on the rise.also, a manipulative macusa security man, percival graves, keeps meeting with the shy credence barebone, a member of a family of anti-wizard extremists. the story is a lot to take in during a two-hour movie, but much easier to digest in rowling's descriptive screenplay. as a result, the characterization in the movie isn't particularly strong, with graves' (played by colin farrell) motives unclear and newt's (eddie redmayne) human relationships (the animal ones are obvious) seeming undeserved. the screenplay, however, fleshes out the characters with descriptions, such as how newt ""recognizes a kindred spirit"" in jacob, and how eventually ""there's a new warmth between"" tina and newt. the screenplay is easy to read, if you're familiar with reading that sort of thing. rowling suspects many aren't, and so the book contains a glossary of film terms, including ""ext. - exterior; an outside location."" at its best, the screenplay can be a learning tool for film fans interested in how director david yates interpreted rowling's words",LIFE; Pg. 3D,USA TODAY,'Beasts' screenplay reveals beyond what's on screen; Rowling offers a breezy companion read to the 'Potter' prequel,11/21/16

""this is just one way technology can help workers do their jobs better and more safely,"" says stephane sireau of ge digital, whose prototype suit was one of many demos at general electric's ""minds + machines"" conference, which wrapped up wednesday. ""our mission is to integrate the worker into a digital industrial context,"" says sireau, showing how the suit's sensors also provide vital-signs data. that information, in turn, can help emergency responders and anticipate workers' health problems. you have probably heard of the internet of things, or iot, which refers to the growing number of web-connected gadgets being pitched to consumers, from thermostats to door locks. but a less familiar acronym is iiot, or the industrial internet of things, which leverages internet connectivity and cloud-based data crunching to, ideally, streamline the worker experience, drive efficiencies into manufacturing logistics and optimize energy resources. long known primarily for making big-ticket hardware devices such as mri machines and jet engines, general electric is doubling down on software and iiot. ge's chief digital officer, bill ruh, has said that the company's digital business, including software and its open-source predix operating system, which debuted in february, will account for $7billion in revenue this year, up from $5 billion in 2015. the company expects to hit $15 billion in revenue by 2020, up from an earlier prediction of $10 billion. by the end of this year, some 20,000 industrial app designers will be developing for predix. by 2020, ge officials say, the iiot economy will hit $225 billion as businesses look to technology to boost their bottom line. such sunny talk immediately raises two dark specters: potential job loss and catastrophic hacking incidents. president-elect donald trump campaigned on a platform of job creation that took tech companies such as apple to task for outsourcing its manufacturing. voters in counties where manufacturing dominates overwhelmingly supported him against rival hillary clinton. some said technology did more harm than good, automating blue-collar jobs that humans once held. and three weeks ago, a massive attack on unsecured iot devices downed the websites of amazon and twitter on the east coast. both topics have ge execs brooding. ""if you're saying you want the job you have to last forever, that's difficult,"" says colin parris, ge's vice president of software research. ""but our feeling is that something like predix can leverage technology to democratize the workplace."" parris gives the example of a factory worker who has an idea on how to solve a problem, but doesn't have computer-coding skills. ""they could use a speech interface to dictate a request to a computer that could then take on the task of writing the code,"" he says. as for the vulnerability of the iiot, parris says the only solution to hacking threats is ""hard work."" he says one way to help safeguard industrial devices is to run repeated threat scenarios that use a machine's ""basic physics"" as a baseline. for example, if a large steam engine operating at peak efficiency is supposed to throw up a very specific set of numbers, any deviation from that norm could indicate a hack and human and computer overseers could respond accordingly. ""we're always attacking ourselves with bots and encouraging others to do the same, and to share that information,"" parris says. not everyone is  sold on the iiot's digital solutions for what have long been hands-on fixes to industrial problems. take microsoft's hololens, $3,000 augmented-reality goggles that can project a holographic image of a mechanical device for off-site troubleshooting. some question whether their employees will welcome putting on a large wearable computer.

" it's shaping up to be just the bloody, grinding urban warfare military leaders long predicted. the latest horror is that militants are arming children, even forcing them to execute citizens. isil fighters might still break and run under the onslaught of u.s.-trained iraqi and kurdish fighters, much as they did during the recapture of two other iraqi cities, fallujah and ramadi, in the past year. but don't count on it. when the shooting dies down, and some experts say that could take weeks, equally important will be the heavy responsibility victory brings. winning the peace will require nimble negotiation efforts by u.s. and international diplomats and, quite possibly, an american military presence for years to come. the surprise takeover of mosul in 2014 by a few thousand isil fighters, who routed demoralized iraqi soldiers, and its proclamation of a new caliphate were signature achievements for the terrorist organization also known as isis. in a rare public appearance that year in mosul's great mosque, isil leader abu bakr al-baghdadi anointed himself ruler of all muslims. more than two years later, as elite iraqi counterterrorism soldiers fight their way deeper into mosul, supported by tanks, artillery and u.s. special forces advisers and attack aircraft, they can expect brutal opposition from an estimated 3,000 to 4,500 militants. suicide attackers, roads and buildings seeded with explosives, and innocent civilians used as human shields are in the offing. a million residents could wind up caught between warring factions. the u.s. military by all accounts has done an exceptional job of rebuilding the iraqi military depleted under former iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki. ""the iraqis are a confident force now. they advance against the enemy. they don't turn and run,"" says james jeffrey, former u.s. ambassador to iraq. moreover, there are smart post-battle plans to use provincial leaders, police and tribal forces to re-establish order and governance in mosul in the short term. the longer-term challenge is pacifying the mosul region beneath a web of intersecting wartime interests by the iraqi government, iraqi kurdistan, turkey and iran. this will be heavy lifting for u.s. and international negotiators who have failed to negotiate a cease-fire agreement that sticks in nearby syria. moreover, there's been little progress in persuading iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi, a shiite muslim, to push for political reforms that would allow sunni iraqis to feel secure and involved in their own governance. the absence of those reforms helped set the stage for the isil military victories in 2014. lastly, the united states learned a hard lesson when u.s. troops left iraq in 2011. about 5,000 are back to support the push on mosul. iraq is certainly more vested in having u.s. forces remain than it was five years ago. the next u.s",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,"Getting it right in Mosul, and what must come after",11/21/16

" it would be one of the largest such roundups in american history. here are answers to many questions about how he will accomplish that. how many ""criminal"" undocumented immigrants are there? in a post-election interview with cbs' 60 minutes, trump said he would deport 2million to 3million of the 11million undocumented immigrants who are ""criminal and have criminal records."" the actual number depends on how one defines ""criminal."" the migration policy institute, a non-partisan think tank, estimates 820,000 undocumented immigrants have been convicted of a crime in the united states. about 300,000 were convicted of felonies and 390,000 of serious misdemeanors. the department of homeland security puts the number of ""removable criminal aliens"" at 1.9million, but that estimate includes foreigners with legal status, people convicted of all crimes (except for traffic offenses) and those repeatedly caught crossing the border. many are already in custody, making them the easiest to identify. the congressional research service estimates more than 142,000 non-citizens were in federal and state prisons and local jails in 2013, the last year for which data are available. the service could not determine how many were undocumented. how will the government track them down? trump could ask congress for more funding to increase the size of immigration and customs enforcement (ice), but a quicker solution would be redirecting the current 14,000 ice officers, agents and special agents to concentrate on arrests. but only 1,000-1,100 agents currently track down fugitive undocumented immigrants who are criminals or gang members, according to john sandweg, a former acting director of ice. the rest work on detention operations, screening visa applicants in foreign countries, conducting immigration audits of u.s. businesses and investigating crimes that include money laundering, import and export fraud, and human trafficking. sandweg said several core functions must be maintained because of congressional mandates, but an ice director could easily refocus more people to finding undocumented immigrants. ""there would be a lot of flexibility for an ice director to recalibrate the agency,"" said sandweg, now an attorney with frontier solutions. how quickly can they be deported? before they can be deported to their home country, immigrants have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge. but immigration courts are  overburdened. that has led to a huge backlog of 521,676 cases waiting nearly two years on average to be heard, according to the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university. cases take an average of 675 days to complete, with some states like colorado averaging more than 1,000 days per case. the only way to speed up those cases is to hire more immigration judges. there are  273, according to the justice department. congress has approved funding to increase the number to 374, and trump could ask congress to hire even more. yet, even if trump filled all 374 posts and added 150 more judges over the next two years, they could not clear out all the  pending immigration cases until 2023, according to a review by human rights first, a non-profit advocacy group. which undocumented immigrants will be targeted? trump's emphasis on criminals may leave millions of other undocumented immigrants in the clear. one such group: the 740,000 young undocumented immigrants granted deportation protections under president obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca. to qualify, they had to register with the federal government, have a clean record and work or go to school. trump has vowed to end the program and rescind their deportation protections, leaving them fearful of being targeted. mexican nationals would be the most heavily targeted, because they account for 52% of undocumented immigrants, according to the pew research center. another 15% come from central america, 13%  from asia, and 6%  from south america. deported mexicans are usually sent home by bus, while those from other countries are put on flights. what will happen to those who remain? as a candidate, trump often hinted that some undocumented immigrants could remain in the u.s. during the 60 minutes interview, he said that after the border is secured, his border wall is completed and ""everything gets normalized,"" he would ""make a determination"" on how to handle those who remain. trump has not elaborated, but republican proposals in recent years provide some possibilities. in 2014, after the senate passed a bill that allowed some undocumented immigrants to become u.s. citizens, house republicans outlined a plan that instead would let them receive legal status, but not citizenship",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,How Trump can ramp up deportations; It could take years to send some undocumented immigrants home because of court backlogs,11/21/16

" a 26-second home movie of the assassination of president john f. kennedy, filmed by a dallas dress manufacturer named abraham zapruder, who found the perfect vantage point along the presidential motorcade route of nov. 22, 1963, is more than historical document. it's a singular window on what, arguably, ended america's overextended, postwar innocence. jfk's murder was a national trauma that still haunts modernity; the zapruder film is its real-time ghost. relied upon by the government for investigative purposes, its ownership controversially acquired by life magazine, even parodied in a famous episode of seinfeld, zapruder's chance creation took on mythic status and, inevitably, burdened the family whose name it bears. the morbid fascination it sparked, and still sparks, make it impossible for the children and relatives of abraham zapruder to take public pride in his legacy, and so it's fitting that his granddaughter, alexandra zapruder, has chosen to tell the story of the film through a familial lens. the result, twenty-six seconds (twelve, 421,  **** out of four),  is a first-rate work of biography and history, addressing the film and the family in all their complexity and character. alexandra zapruder was born in 1969 and became aware of what made her last name famous, as  children often will, through a kind of osmosis: ""i have no memory of learning this fact,"" she confides. ""it seems to me that i always knew it."" zapruder (author of salvaged pages: young writers' diaries of the holocaust) writes elegantly and with keen sensitivity about the toll the film took on her late father, henry, a lawyer who became the film's guardian after abraham's death. henry zapruder bore the brunt as the family and federal government fought over the film's ownership, copyright and monetary value, and as the press weighed in, fairly or not, on the family's morality, at times accusing it of profiteering on the death of a president. zapruder knows well the fraught cultural issues at play here, given that her parents descend from jewish immigrants who built a comfortably middle-class existence in the dallas suburbs. but the family's quiet instinct -- to compartmentalize the 26 seconds as an aspect of zapruder identity rather than as an object that defined them -- was dwarfed by the film's outsized fame. studied frame by frame by the warren commission to conclude that the assassin, lee harvey oswald, acted alone, the 8mm kodachrome print became a totem for conspiracy theory, including oliver stone's 1991 film, jfk.

""if he were able to do that, i don't know really how much impact it would have because we're moving ahead and rebalancing our portfolio,"" nick akins, the president and ceo of american electric power, said recently. ""i think it's going to be very difficult for new coal-fired generation to get developed,"" he said. obama-era policies requiring reductions in emissions of carbon, mercury and other pollutants have contributed to coal's loss of market share in the power sector. even more significant has been record u.s. production of cheap shale gas, thanks to hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, plus the slow but steady penetration of wind and solar energy into power markets. ""it's a seven-year construction cycle for a coal unit; 15 years for a nuclear unit,"" akins said in a phone call from aep's columbus, ohio, headquarters. ""you can develop a natural gas plant in two to three years, with a lot less risk for shareholders, and the price of natural gas as a fuel source is still substantially low. ""and there are areas of the country that benefit from low-cost renewable fuels, particularly wind, and solar continues to come down as well, particularly utility-scale solar. those are areas that will continue to develop."" for aep, which has 5.4 million customers in 11 states, coal's share of the company's generating capacity has fallen from 71% in 2005 to about 47% in 2017. over that time, gas capacity has risen from 20% to 27%, and renewable energy has jumped from 3% to 13%. the switch is happening even faster across the usa, where gas surpasses coal as a fuel for power plants. all told, the u.s. energy information administration expects gas to provide an average of 34% of the electricity generated in the usa in 2016, compared with 30% for coal. also figuring heavily in utility investment decisions are changing expectations among customers, especially demands for ""clean energy"" among younger customers. ""there's no doubt that there's an element of environmental stewardship that continues to be part of the fabric of our investment thesis,"" akins said. trump's bid to reverse obama environmental policies may provide a reprieve for some older coal power plants, though gas prices, if they remain low, will probably cut into those units' operating time, according to the utility chief. at the same time, trump's bullish support for gas production and pipeline construction may exacerbate coal's competitive problems. ""we'll still have the capacity available, but we won't be using the units as much, and you'll see more utilization of natural gas to back up intermittent renewable energy,"" akins said. trump's commitment to promote new infrastructure may benefit companies such as aep, whose 40,000-mile electric transmission network is the largest in the usa. aep spends more than $3 billion a year on transmission improvements, including projects designed to bring new renewable and distributed energy to market. ""there's no question that jobs are being created on the infrastructure side of things,"" he said. as for communities where aep has shuttered coal power plants, the company works with economic-development officials in states such as kentucky and west virginia to see whether the sites can be marketed for new manufacturing",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Coal's decline may continue under Trump administration; Cheap shale gas has become major force in energy markets,11/21/16
" she's also a fervent conservative who regularly airs her political views on twitter. ""so proud of my hispanic heritage and so proud to support @realdonaldtrump for president!!"" she tweeted in september under a hashtag celebrating hispanic heritage month. soon after, she began receiving personal attacks and death threats, she says. rowlands reported the abuse but she says twitter did nothing. and, she says, it wasn't the first time twitter ignored concerns for her safety that she and her twitter followers expressed and even reported to police. ""i want to stress that it's not like we're crying victim or anything like that,"" rowlands said in an interview. ""it's just that we're pointing out the double standard."" rampant abuse on twitter is in the spotlight coming off a bitterly divisive election season that turned the social media service into a political battleground. when it comes to policing behavior from warring sides that crosses the line, conservatives say twitter is guilty of left-wing favoritism. the rash of recent suspensions of high-profile alt-right accounts is more evidence of that favoritism, they say. ""the commonality of these groups that are being targeted is their politics, and you don't see it on the other side as much,"" d.c. mcallister, a columnist for conservative news service pj media and the federalist, said in an interview. ""there are twitter accounts on the left that are suspended, but it's not en masse like it is here."" whether twitter has taken a more aggressive stance with some users over its harassment policies is hard to prove: twitter gives few details, if any, when it suspends accounts, and some observers say the fault lies more in its failure to rein in abuse regardless of the political tilt. but the perception that it has a double standard runs strong. twitter's suspension of alt-right leader richard spencer contributed to the suspicion that twitter is arbitrarily stifling conservative speech. spencer, who coined the term alt right in 2010, says he was tossed from twitter for his political views -- he wants to segregate the united states by racial groups -- not for harassing twitter users. he was suspended alongside the accounts of other white nationalists. conservatives say their ouster fits a pattern of liberal bias. in july when ghostbusters actress leslie jones was subjected to racist and sexist taunts led by breitbart technology editor milo yiannopoulos, twitter ceo jack dorsey intervened and yanked yiannopoulos from the service. yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper talib kweli and his followers when they attacked black breitbart reporter jerome hudson with racial slurs. when breitbart contributor kassy dillon complained about a twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot dillon in the head. twitter refused to comment directly on the allegation that it ignores abuse hurled at conservatives. ""the twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies,"" the company said in an emailed statement. long before the contentious election, twitter was under growing pressure to cut off the gushing fire hose of hate and harassment that targeted people. users don't have to reveal their real names on twitter and that anonymity emboldens them to attack women, people of color, muslims, gays and other groups, even threaten rape and death. the alt right, a loose-knit group that embraces white nationalism among other things, gained prominence during the presidential campaign for using social media to spread its ideology through viral memes and anonymous attacks on users from pro-donald trump accounts. ""while we have taken steps over the years to try to combat abuse and harassment, we haven't moved as quickly as we would have liked or we haven't always done as much as we would have liked because we have tried to make sure we are not making decisions that have unintended, negative consequences and ramifications,"" del harvey, twitter's head of safety, recently told usa today. as a private platform, twitter is not required to treat all users equally. but conservatives say they see public shows of support for liberals and their causes, such as gay rights and racial justice, yet twitter turns a deaf ear when left-wing activists target them. ""when liberals complain, jack dorsey is on their side. he sees their point of view. he cares about their feelings,"" said rowlands, who is president of the uc irvine college republicans, a group that had a run-in with campus administrators when it hosted an event with yiannopoulos. ""but because i am a conservative, it seems like twitter doesn't actually care,"" she said. ""they selectively choose when they want to follow their own rules."" james grimmelmann, a cornell law professor who studies social networks, says he does not believe twitter's lapses are politically motivated. complaints are just as common on the left as they are on the right, he said.

" in a reality that is more important after the election: recessions are more common under republican presidents. every republican president since teddy roosevelt in the early 1900's endured a recession in their first term, according to an analysis from sam stovall, chief investment strategist at stock research firm cfra. four republican presidents suffered through two recessions while in office and republican president dwight eisenhower presided over three. meanwhile, democrats have largely skated past the recession quicksand. four in five democratic presidents saw no recessions during their terms since 1945, stovall says. while history isn't gospel, the track record makes the odds of a recession during president trump's term all the more likely, stovall says.""from a probability perspective, a recession is very likely in president trump's first term in office,"" he says. interestingly, recessions aren't the only indicator of economic slowdown that appear during times of republican presidents. real gdp growth, a measure of economic activity in the u.s., averaged 3.33% during the 64 years and 16 presidential terms going back to president truman in the mid-1940s, according to a 2013 research paper by professors of economics alan blinder and mark watson at princeton university. with a republican in the white house, though, the economy's growth slowed to 2.54%, the economists found. with a democrat in office, growth jumped to 4.35% on average. a variety of other economic indicators, such as per capital gdp, stock market returns, real wages and the change in the unemployment rate, are also more robust with a democratic president, the economists found. unemployment fell by 0.8 percentage points with a democratic president on average, while it rose 1.1% with a republican. ""the u.s. economy has performed better when the president of the united states is a democrat rather than a republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance,"" according to the report titled ""presidents and the economy: a forensic investigation."" academics and market historians are trying to figure out why the economy tends to stall out with a republican president.  research offers a few suggestions, including: random 'good luck.' democrats have had the fortune of being in office when favorable random shocks go their way during their terms, blinder and watson found. big drops in oil prices, positive boosts in productivity and also optimistic consumer outlooks tend to occur during democratic administrations, they said. none of these factors is  tied directly to the actions of the president, the professors found, these three factors explain upwards of 62% of the better economic performance. lag times for policies to kick in. evidence pointing to better economic growth under democrats is an illusion created by the timing of when presidents enter office, says timothy kane at the hoover institution think tank at stanford university. factoring in the one-year lag between the time a new president is elected and when the policy effects kick in, ""there is no statistically significant advantage for either party in the white house,"" kane says. presidents inherit problems that were created by policy decisions before they were elected, kane says. the business cycle. the economy follows a natural progression of expansion, peaking and contraction which is more powerful than the president, stovall says.

" while the tech-friendly free trade agreement won't come up for a vote during the current lame-duck session of congress, that doesn't mean it won't be resurrected in some form under president-elect donald trump. in the past two weeks, trump has walked back from some of his more radical and impractical campaign promises, giving hope to some in silicon valley that he would do the same with his anti-trade rhetoric. trump denounced the tpp as a ""disaster"" being ""pushed by special interests who want to rape our country."" yet he appears to have included rolf lundberg jr., a former lobbyist from the tpp-friendly u.s. chamber of commerce, to head up ""trade reform"" on his presidential transition team, according to an organization chart obtained by the new york times. trump's transition team has been notoriously fluid. its new executive director was recently removing lobbyists from the team, so if lundberg had a place on it, he may not any longer. but if he or the chamber have any say in trump's trade policy, you may see a softer stance than heard on the campaign trail. the u.s. chamber of commerce is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the country, representing american business interests around the globe. it's a huge advocate for free trade, including the tpp. in a sign of its influence, the chamber led the lobbying effort that pressured republicans into giving president obama fast-track trade negotiating authority over the tpp. this not only gave the white house carte blanche to hammer out a deal on its own, but also barred congress from making any changes to it. lundberg, who  runs a lobbying group focused on the travel industry, managed the chamber's political program from 2001 to 2013, where he oversaw candidate endorsements, as well as the chamber's  political action committee. some of that lobbying included the tpp, public filings indicate. as far back as 2009 and until 2013, lundberg's name appears on several of the chamber's quarterly lobbying disclosure forms in sections that list tpp as a topic lobbyists raised with lawmakers. blair latoff holmes, a spokeswoman  for the chamber, confirmed that in 2013 the lobbying group was advocating ""u.s. and foreign negotiators for specific provisions to be included in the tpp,"" but that lundberg ""was not involved in that effort."" lundberg declined to comment on reports he was involved in the trump transition team. the trump transition team did not return requests for comment. lundberg's history  doesn't necessarily mean that he'll be championing the free trade agreement if he's on board with the new trump administration. silicon valley is a big fan of tpp as it is one of the first free trade agreements to specifically address the changing realities of the new digital economy. telecommunication firms, like verizon, sprint and at&t, which offer voice and data services in many tpp countries already, will benefit from new rules that bar preferential treatment of local carriers, especially in vietnam, where the local carrier is state-owned. electronic retailers like amazon and ebay should flourish under tpp as well, as the agreement sets up a legal framework to facilitate electronic payments and protect personal information exchanged online between customers and merchants. tpp can help  trump achieve the 4% per annum gdp growth he promised to deliver on the campaign trail. tpp helps address many of the problems that u.s. service providers bump up against when trying to expand abroad and helps facilitate the free-flow of data. lundberg is  well-versed on the tpp and its benefits from his work at the chamber",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Trans-Pacific Partnership may stay alive in another form,11/21/16

" that is the choice donald trump has presented from the day he declared his white house candidacy to each moment of his transition process as president-elect. all the institutional machinery of the office is kicking in, conferring legitimacy on an incendiary novice who has brought into his administration a white nationalist sympathizer and a retired general who led chants of ""lock her up"" at the republican convention. trump himself is still tweeting insults -- at protestors, the press, now even the broadway cast of hamilton. trump clearly doesn't give a rip about international norms and treaties (sen. john mccain has already warned him to back off on resuming torture) or about conflicts of interest. he is already using his new job to drum up business with associates from india (ivanka and donald jr., who will be running the family business, were there too), and to encourage foreign officials to stay at his new washington, d.c. hotel. he had ivanka sit in on a meeting with the prime minister of japan. nbc's andrea mitchell reported that his team wanted clearance for his son-in-law -- a newspaper publisher -- to attend intelligence briefings on dire threats facing the u.s. (the trump camp denied that.) so it will be a daily struggle to resist normalization, but my vote is we should never allow it to happen. personnel, policy and especially ethics demand it. david: the press, including me, spent much of the election trying not to ""normalize"" trump. he was a uniquely awful candidate, from his blatantly fraudulent ""trump university,"" to his promiscuous approach to litigation, to his serial bankruptcies. but the voters have spoken. they normalized him. any time we spend on this, is time spent fighting to delegitimize our democratic republic. only trump's actions can undermine his standing, not anything we might say. and so far his appointments are not far off the mark. he's appointed retired lt. gen. mike flynn as his national security advisor, a position for which he is eminently qualified despite his big mouth. alabama sen. jeff sessions, trump's appointee for attorney general, is another guy who is well-qualified, but said some stupid things three decades ago. they both have trump beat in that they have appropriate experience for their jobs and they have said far fewer offensive things than trump, including never admitting to sexual assault with a camera running. kansas rep. mike pompeo, trump's nominee for cia director, who was a corporate ceo after time as an army officer and harvard law, sounds like the kind of person a normal republican president would nominate, not to mention that in the republican primaries, he backed florida sen. marco rubio, the most normal of candidates. grading trump on a curve, i'd say he has exceeded expectations. jill: why should we grade trump on a curve? that's been the problem all along. the key measure ought to be how conservatives and the media would treat hillary clinton in a parallel circumstance -- and in fact how they did treat her. trump called her ""crooked hillary."" and yet, he's the one that settled the trump university fraud lawsuit for $25 million and is entangled in more than 70 other pending lawsuits. say what you will about clinton, she's never been sued for cheating students out of their life savings. flynn, the prospective national security advisor who yelled ""lock her up"" about clinton, was paid to attend a dinner sponsored by a russian-run propaganda outlet, and sat next to vladimir putin. imagine if top clinton aide huma abedin had done that. setting the bar this low gives ""normalizing"" a bad name. david: the clinton family and their various enablers are big reasons trump is president. where did republican voters get the idea that appalling sexual behavior outside of marriage is just fine if it advances your partisan goals? where did republican voters get the idea that gazillion dollar conflicts of interest while serving in high office are peachy if your side is doing it? where did republican voters get the idea that repeating blatant lies is good politics? the clintons have some explaining to do. casting hillary as a victim lets her off too easily. and so far, i am hopeful that republican senators and congressmen are going to be less susceptible to the temptation to defend all of trump's foolishness long after the point that it gets absurd. as you mentioned, mccain is already warning trump of his red lines. kentucky sen. rand paul is signaling opposition to some of trump's potential nominees and the conservative press is stocked with right-wingers who will refuse to defend trump when he goes off the deep end. but for any of that to work, everybody has to back off trump and let him get his administration started. if we're always at defcon 1 -- over every nominee, over every meeting, over every tweet, the vast bulk of the country is just going to tune us out. the fact is that president trump is the new normal for the next four years. jill: that is a very scary thought, especially if trump doesn't get the hell off twitter. believe me, i understand his addiction -- i love it way too much myself. but this hamilton dust-up, far from the most important thing that's happened since election day, is such a perfect example of how hard trump makes it to back off. condemning the cast in repeated tweets, demanding an apology for a super-polite request to ""work on behalf of all of us,"" when he himself hasn't apologized for the painful things he has said about prisoners of war, gold star families and many others -- it's hypocritical but, alas, typical. it also confirms that trump isn't quite up to speed on the constitution (free speech rights, remember?) and has some odd priorities (insult tweets during a presidential transition? really?) pence's response -- he wasn't offended, trump will be president of ""all the people"" -- was far more appropriate for a national leader. so maybe we have learned something: that in this partnership trump will forever be the bad cop, the enfant terrible, the headline-maker. maybe he will get bored and pull a ""sarah palin"" in a year. in the meantime, it's comforting to think about the political pendulum. if past is prologue, we are looking at a 2020 winner who is a young, experienced, level-headed democrat. david: when it comes to anything ""trumpian,"" never say never, but i think dreaming of impeachment or hoping trump quits or imagining the perfect democrat to replace him in 2021 is a distraction. people need to get past the hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing and get used to the fact that trump will be president for four years. and eight isn't out of the question. i am actually more optimistic about his prospects almost two weeks after the election than i was before. trump is putting in place qualified people who echo his plain talk and support the policies he promised in his campaign. that's the best anyone can realistically hope for. david mastio, a libertarian conservative, is the deputy editor of usa today's editorial page",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,New normal or not normal?; Trump transition is clearing a bar.

" even a cursory look at a u.s. electoral map shows a striking red/blue divide that in most cases separates big cities and coastal areas from the rest of america. as angry protesters rage in the streets, one can easily conclude that we've never been so irreconcilably divided. but this is nothing new. throughout our history we have, of course, found ourselves at odds -- again and again. so how have we healed the wounds that divided the nation in the past? to look into this question, usa today asked three historians to consider times when the usa was torn apart by bitter politics, assassinations and even war -- and how we bridged the deep divisions. we chose two recent moments, both within the past 50 years, and a cataclysmic moment from more than 150 years ago. all three historians made the case that, at least in the instances we chose, the usa didn't so much heal as figure out a way to pass the pain on to others in the name of healing. even as cataclysmic events came to their official end, aftershocks and adjustments followed -- sometimes in violence, sometimes in votes. and in their own ways, all three moments reveal that we're still coming to terms with the issues laid bare, from racial violence and racially based resentment to distrust of government and conflicts over angry free speech vs. law and order. 1. the end of the civil war, april 1865 on april 9, 1865, confederate gen. robert e. lee surrendered to union gen. ulysses s. grant in appomattox, va. the surrender ended the bitter four-year war, and eight months later the usa adopted the 13th amendment to the constitution, which outlawed slavery nationwide. our ""national story"" is that we did, indeed, begin healing that day in april 1865, said university of richmond historian edward ayers. ""when you think about the stories we like to tell, we like to tell the story about appomattox -- lee and grant shaking hands, grant sending those southern boys home with their guns and horses, and lee handing his sword and so forth."" but even a casual student of history might tell you the reality was much more complex. lee's surrender and grant's gracious response were indeed significant, said ayers. and considering how other nations' civil wars have ended, ""it's an accomplishment."" but many historians believe reconstruction and the 12-year ""bloodbath"" waged against southern blacks that followed the war showed that the violence of the civil war wasn't done playing out. peace was bought ""at the expense of black americans,"" ayers said. under the terms of reconstruction, the white south maintained control of the region, while the north ""got to run the country,"" he said. ""you could argue that the white south basically traded white supremacy for national supremacy, which they had very much held since the founding of the nation,"" said ayers, one of the co-hosts of backstory, a nationally syndicated history radio show and podcast. abraham lincoln had, of course, pushed for unity -- his second inaugural address, delivered on march 4, 1865, as the war wound down, concluded with a plea: ""with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" six weeks later, and six days after the war's end, lincoln was assassinated. eventually, lee's surrender produced a kind of national reunification, ayers said -- which, considering that nearly a million people had died, was not assured. but what was missing, he said, was any sort of ""truth-and-reconciliation"" effort through which the nation could come to terms with a 250-year legacy of slavery. ""you could argue that that is the unhealed wound from all of this,"" ayers said. ""we bought national reconciliation at the expense of really treating that wound of slavery -- and that we're still living with the consequences of that today."" in 1877, president rutherford b. hayes, a one-time union soldier who had been wounded in action, toured the south in a ""peacemaking"" tour. he also ordered the final federal troops removed from the south in a kind of ceremonial end of reconstruction. ""the fact that we don't remember that suggests that it only went so far,"" ayers said. in one poignant moment in 1938, during the 75th anniversary of the battle of gettysburg, a handful of surviving civil war veterans, dressed in suits and fedoras, reached across a rock wall to shake hands for newsreel cameras. ""that was seen as the great reconciliation of north and south,"" ayers said. nonetheless, a look at voting patterns after the civil war showed that southerners voted for democrats and ""against the north"" for more than a century. ""as the saying went, 'people voted as they had shot.'"" then, a century later, came the civil rights era. 2. the assassination of the rev. martin luther king jr., april 1968 in the mid-1960s, a decade of expanding rights for african-americans culminated in the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965. the measures, shepherded by president lyndon b. johnson, were approved just months after the 1963 assassination of president john f. kennedy, who had pushed for expanded civil rights. they effectively began the transformation of a century-long voting pattern in the south, turning whites against the democratic party and, in the 1960s, stirring intense passions against african-american civil rights leaders. king, an atlanta preacher who rose to prominence in the late 1950s and who delivered the ""i have a dream"" speech during the march on washington, d.c., in 1963, was one of the key leaders of the movement, spearheading efforts for desegregation, voting rights and unionization. on april 4, 1968, visiting memphis to support striking sanitation workers, he was shot and killed at a local motel. the assassination sparked riots in cities nationwide, and many americans of both races looked to sen. robert f. kennedy, jfk's younger brother, for leadership and a measure of solace. while jfk ""was remembered far more fondly in death than he was in life,"" said yohuru williams, a professor of history at fairfield university, ""there was still this idea that with bobby kennedy you had somebody who would continue that legacy."" the younger kennedy, then a senator from new york and an insurgent candidate for the democratic nomination in the 1968 presidential election, had worked on anti-poverty programs in both urban and rural america. he ""would have been a stabilizing influence,"" williams said. ""in a lot of ways, it was bobby kennedy who represented the hopes for a reconciliation of some substance."" then, exactly nine weeks after king's death, kennedy was killed in the kitchen of a los angeles hotel ballroom. he'd been campaigning in california -- moments before his death, kennedy had addressed supporters after winning the state's democratic primary. stunned democrats, facing the prospect of running against republican richard m. nixon, who'd narrowly lost to jfk just eight years earlier, failed to coalesce around their establishment candidate, vice president hubert humphrey. that summer in chicago, the televised spectacle of a chaotic convention, in which protesters in the streets clashed violently with police, terrified many americans, williams said. while nixon's base of voters understood ""law and order"" as a healing idea, others weren't so sure, he said. ""what you get with nixon is an affirmation of the divisions."" 3. nixon's resignation and pardon by president gerald ford, august-september 1974 six years later, nixon was in trouble. after more than a year of dogged pursuit by congressional lawmakers and the press following the 1972 watergate break-in, nixon finally resigned the presidency. in a bid to end the bitter conflict, president gerald ford pardoned nixon for all federal crimes that he ""committed or may have committed or taken part in"" while in office. while nixon's resignation derailed a certain impeachment, ford's pardon derailed possible federal charges against nixon related to the break-in at the democratic national committee headquarters, as well as a subsequent, high-level cover-up. the pardon ""caused very concentrated and impassioned anger"" nationwide, said nixon scholar and historian rick perlstein. ""i think that actually the ford pardon did not heal america."" perlstein, author of the 2008 book nixonland, added, ""basically what ford was saying was that you could get away with crimes if you were powerful enough. it's one of the most dangerous tendencies in american political culture. he was implicitly saying, 'i don't have faith in the american justice system.'"" though the pardon took a bruising criminal trial off the table, nixon's wrongdoing ""was kind of left hanging,"" perlstein said. ""i think if anything, it contributed to an american sense that the government couldn't be trusted."" a criminal trial ""would have been exhausting, as all conflicts that genuinely address serious wounds are. but there would have been catharsis. that's why we have a justice system."" the pattern has played out at least three times in the three decades since then, perlstein noted: once in the 1980s, when democrats decided it would be too divisive to pursue a broader iran-contra investigation during the reagan administration. then, in 1991, bitter confirmation hearings for supreme court justice clarence thomas featured explicit testimony of sexual harassment from anita hill, one of thomas' former advisers. and in 2009, after president obama took office, he intervened in a federal lawsuit that had pitted two oregon attorneys against the george w. bush administration. shortly after inauguration, obama asked vaughn walker, a u.s. district judge in san francisco, to set aside a ruling on classified evidence in the sensitive post-9/11 wiretapping case. an accidentally released secret memo had suggested that the federal government eavesdropped without warrants on the attorneys, who worked for the oregon chapter of a now-defunct saudi charity. obama opted to back up the bush administration in the case. in 2010, walker ordered the u.s. government to pay more than $2.5 million in attorney fees and damages to the oregon attorneys. in all of these cases, perlstein said, leaders in essence have urged americans to ""look forward, not backward"" at wrongdoing. but viewed through a slightly different prism, they were simply looking the other way. ""the longing to sweep problems under the rug is one of the founding acts of american political culture,"" he said.

" a classic thanksgiving dinner will cost $49.87 for a gathering of 10, just under $5 per person, according to figures out this week from the american farm bureau federation. the total is a step back from 2015's all-time high of $50.11. ""if you adjust for inflation, the price is lower this year than when we first started tracking the cost 31 years ago,"" said dr. john newton, afbf's director of marketing intelligence. ""the dollar goes a long way."" the farm bureau tracks the price of 16 thanksgiving staples, including turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, vegetables, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk. the falling cost of a 16-pound turkey drove down the overall price, newton said. the average dropped to $22.74, or about $1.42 per pound, a 1% decrease from 2015. the price drop may be a transition back to the norm, he said. that's because a significant bird flu outbreak last year hurt the nation's supply of turkey and eggs. ramped-up production of milk in the united states and european union brought down the cost of a gallon jug to $3.17, an 8-cent drop, newton said. and while other staples ticked up in price -- pie shells rose 12 cents to $2.59 and a dozen rolls rose 21 cents to $2.46 -- the overall cost of the meal has gone down. ""when it costs less than $5 per person to put the fundamentals on the table, you have money to buy additional fixings,"" newton said. the afbf gathers its data from a team of 150 volunteer shoppers across the nation, who look for the lowest prices without taking advantage of special promotions. bargain-conscious consumers should be able to find similar prices, newton said. some other bargain-hunting tips: buy frozen turkey, rather than fresh, but make sure to allow enough time for thawing: a 16-pound bird takes about 31/2 days in the refrigerator to fully defrost. make your thanksgiving feast a potluck so your guests can share in the culinary glory. use smaller plates",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"Cost of Thanksgiving dinner takes a dip; Adjusted for inflation, price lowest in 31 years",11/21/16

""traffic is bad, huh?"" i said, in a voice that felt a little too high and a little too loud. and marie said, ""yes."" that was it. we had nothing more to say. there was nothing more, literally, we could say. but we learned to communicate, and we shared a lot with this family. we shared meals, stories and our lives. we watched a 5-year-old girl on her first day of school. we watched a 36-year-old mother drive a car for the first time. and we watched that same mother suffer when her father died. she came here, he stayed in a refugee camp 6,000 miles away, and they never saw each other again. i was surprised by how difficult life is here. there's this idea that once refugees resettle in america, the battle is fought and won, but that's not true. a hard part is over, yes, but there are harder parts yet to come. they get bills they can't read or pay. marie works, but a refugee in the u.s. starts out in debt from plane tickets. it's tough to climb out of that hole. we watched them struggle to learn english, and we watched them grapple with homesickness. they didn't want to come here, but now they are trying so hard to want to stay. we first met the alhamouds on nov. 13, 2015, the day isis terrorists killed 130 people in paris. one of the terrorists was found with a fake syrian passport. in two months, donald trump - who has vowed to stop isis and called for a ban on muslim immigration -- will become president of the united states. it's a tough time, politically, to be an immigrant, to be muslim, to be anything seen as ""other."" but this family doesn't dwell on that. ahlam, the mother, said a few days after the election that she doesn't think about hillary clinton or donald trump. she thinks instead about her children, their education and their futures. that is her only care. when meg looks at this family, she is overwhelmed by how much the parents sacrifice for their children. marie says he owes it to them, as a father, to make sure they get an education. ahlam spends every moment trying to make their lives happier and better. when i look at this family, i see a reflection of my own. i also grew up in a family of nine, so i know what it's like to buy food in bulk, to wear weird hand-me-downs and to cram a lot of people into a little van. this family of refugees feels familiar to me, and that's comforting. but it's also unsettling, because it is all too easy to imagine my family in their place. if they can get ripped from their home by war -- forced to start completely over -- it can happen to anyone. i moved to cincinnati about two years ago, and in a sense, it was starting over. a new job, a new city -- at the time, it felt like everything was new. now, watching the alhamouds navigate ohio, i realize how wrong i was. moving from one part of the state to another is something. moving from one part of the world to another -- a part of the world where you don't know anyone and the language and culture are new -- is something much, much bigger. it's exciting. it's hopeful. it's scary. and to me, it's a strong dose of perspective. we are different. and yet we are so much the same. when meg and i walk through the alhamouds' door, the younger children immediately climb all over us. they grab meg's camera and shoot photos of their own. one of the girls, zina, likes to take notes during interviews and compare them to mine. it's a little uncomfortable, as journalists, to be that close to our subjects, but it's wonderful, as humans, to be that close to people. we stopped by recently, and baby yousif's fingers were covered in cheetos dust. that meant we also got covered in cheetos dust. it's not a great look",NEWS; Pg. 2A,USA TODAY,Baby's Cheetos dust melted my heart,11/21/16

" maybe it just feels worse because of the airspace intrusion of an oversized seatmate or a yapping emotional-support poodle. this may be the right moment to bring up travel minimalism, which can help you make it through even the most claustrophobia-inducing voyage. ""being a minimalist traveler frees up mental capacity to enjoy the experience,"" says timo way, who has taught classes on traveling with less. too many passengers think the art of taking less begins and ends with the packing adage ""roll, don't fold."" not true. it applies to every part of your trip, from selecting the right seat to bringing practical, space-saving clothes, luggage and electronics. and yes, anyone can do it. the less-is-more philosophy extends to how much travelers consume, and that's particularly true for people who embrace minimalism for environmental reasons, says joshua becker, author of the book the more of less: finding the life you want under everything you own. for them, downsizing means fitting into a smaller, more fuel-efficient car or refusing to play the loyalty points game to score an elusive upgrade into an over-the-top business-class seat with all-you-can-drink wine and fawning service. minimalists are content with a downsized travel experience. ""we need far less than we think,"" becker says. decluttering consultant debora levi said there's a reason minimalism is catching on among travelers. the idea that you have to take everything is a direct response to the reality of modern travel, where airlines charge for carry-on items and personal space is shrinking. minimalist travelers take less with them, but the most committed declutterers discard their unnecessary belongings even before their trip ends. for example, one of levi's clients flies from miami to new york, then donates her winter coat before returning home. francine jay, the author of the joy of less: a minimalist guide to declutter, organize, and simplify, says there's something about the time of year that makes people go minimal. nothing stresses you out like holiday travel, but having to haul a lot of gifts with you is enough to trigger a nervous breakdown. ""when you don't have to check your luggage, wait for it at the baggage carousel or worry the whole time about losing it, you have more time and energy to enjoy your trip,"" she says. beyond ""roll, don't fold"" and avoid checking luggage, what else can you do to travel minimalist? it can be summed up into three little words: less is more. don't bring something you can buy at your destination, such as large tubes of sunblock or toothpaste, and when you're done with your trip, leave the items you don't need at your destination or donate them. this encourages you to buy things in smaller amounts. (if you want really small quantities, try a site such as minimus.biz, which sells trial-size toiletries in tsa-approved amounts.) do something about your clothes. i spoke with hard-core minimalists for this story who buy underwear at their destination, then discard it before returning home. others swear by synthetic travel underwear by companies such as exofficio. i own a few pairs myself, and they allow me to dramatically reduce the size of my carry-on. you can wash them in your hotel sink, and they dry quickly. depending on the length of your trip, take one or two changes of clothes. you can't go wrong with black, says martha merritt, dean of the office of international education at the university of richmond. ""you will look more like a native wherever you go outside the united states,"" she says. oh, and lose those bulky electronics, too. the most accomplished declutterers leave the laptop or tablet computer at home and learn how to do everything on their smartphone. this holiday season, the line separating the stressed travelers from the relaxed ones may also divide the minimalists from the rest. they're easy to spot in their dark clothes, dictating emails into their smartphones, unworried about the fate of their checked baggage. sounds appealing to me. elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for national geographic traveler make your carry-on smaller. if you need a hard-sided carry-on, you can still get the benefits of expandable luggage with the new briggs & riley sympatico cx international carry-on spinner (briggs-riley.com, $529). it expands by 25% and then compresses back to its original size. un-bulk your wallet. check out zeroz, a minimalist wallet (zeroz.com, $35-105). this is your wallet on a diet. it's slim but doesn't give up any of the functionality of a traditional wallet, with a cash strap and a quick-access tab for your driver's license. shrink your stuff. i'm a big fan of packing cubes like the travelwise packing cube system (eatsmartproducts.com, $24.95). these lightweight nylon cubes let you stuff your shirts, pants and dresses into small compartments for streamlined packing",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,'Tis the season for minimalist travel,11/21/16

" wade"" is not the only threat to reproductive rights for women under a donald trump administration, as noted in rich wolf's article, ""can president trump undermine abortion rights? not so fast."" in fact, there is a dangerous and long list of attacks that will restrict access to abortion, birth control and basic reproductive health care. president-elect trump may cut the purse strings that make funding women's reproductive health care a reality by reinstating and preserving bans on abortion funding here and abroad without exceptions for rape, incest or life of the woman. overturning the affordable care act could also limit access to free and affordable contraception for millions of women and girls. vice president-elect mike pence championed the effort to defund planned parenthood and has championed shutting down family planning clinics that serve poor and vulnerable women. we don't have to wonder what the impacts of these dangerous policies will be. when access to reproductive rights is restricted and budget for family planning is slashed, contraception use declines and the rates of unsafe abortions increase. what trump, pence and anti-choice politicians have shown is that you don't have to remove the law that makes abortion legal. you can simply make it inaccessible. brian dixon population connection washington, d.c. facebook abortion is used as a tool to get the votes of weak-minded americans. republicans have the house, senate and presidency and still, it ain't gonna happen. wise up, fellow americans",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,"Pro-life tactics can be sneaky, irresponsible",11/22/16

"9 billion hours a year stuck in traffic, according to american society of civil engineers. at the risk of stating the obvious, that is a lot. if each of these vehicles -- which include buses -- had an average of 1.5 adults in them, these vehicle hours would translate to roughly 5 million unpaid full-time jobs. or enough hours to build the empire state building and the hoover dam more than 100 times each. and the numbers are getting worse quickly. by 2020, those 6.9 billion lost hours are projected to be 8.3 billion lost hours. which is a good way of saying that america needs a big jolt of investment in transportation infrastructure. a trillion dollars over the next 10 years on top of the roughly $900 billion already slated would not be extravagant. a good bit of that is needed just to fix facilities that have fallen into disrepair. and significant investments in new capacity are needed to keep the u.s. economy from falling behind. these would include expanding roads and constructing highways as well as mass transit systems. while this might seem impossible for a federal government nearly $20 trillion in debt, and for states that face their own looming pension crises, it is not. in fact, it would likely pay for itself in enhanced economic activity. the civil engineers estimate that the economic cost from underinvestment in infrastructure is $147 billion annually, rising to $238 billion in 2025. and yet resistance to such a wise investment is endemic. since 2002, federal spending on transportation infrastructure has dropped 23% (adjusted for inflation). states have decreased their spending by 30%. president obama included a modest and short-lived uptick in infrastructure spending in his 2009 fiscal stimulus. but then he spent the next seven years urging more, to no avail. now the voters have elected donald trump as president. he, too, is a big supporter of infrastructure spending, proposing a $550 billion injection at the federal level over the next decade. as is often the case in washington these days, much of the focus and attention is on the gimmicky ways the program might be financed. rather than offsetting the cost with tax hikes or spending cuts, or simply declaring that the boost to the economy would fund the plan, trump wants to finance it through a tax windfall from repatriated corporate profits overseas. by declaring a temporary rate of 10% (well below the current 35%), much of the estimated $2trillion being held overseas by u.s. corporations would come home, where it would be both taxed and invested in the domestic economy. that might seem like a good idea. but it would complicate efforts at a permanent reform of the tax code that would prevent so much money from staying abroad in the first place. regardless of what fig leaf congress comes up with, investment in getting around is greatly needed",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Americans spend 6.9 billion thankless hours in traffic,11/22/16
" or is it? two weeks after election day, donald trump is assembling his cabinet while votes in many states are still being counted. hillary clinton's lead in the popular vote continues to grow. michigan's 16 electoral votes remain up for grabs. and so the question: how confident can americans be in the results announced in the wee hours of nov. 9, given the problems that continue to beset our election system? here are some answers: q: who won the electoral vote? a: as of monday, trump has 290 votes to clinton's 232, with michigan outstanding. even if clinton wins there -- a possibility despite trump's lead since election night -- she still would trail, 290-248. among other states where the vote was close, only florida could flip the election. but clinton trails there and in pennsylvania and wisconsin by too many votes to trigger an automatic recount. q: who won the popular vote? a: clinton's lead of about 1.7million votes continues to increase, largely from an influx of absentee and provisional ballots being counted in california. she has about 63.7 million votes to trump's 62 million; her margin in california is about 3.5 million. q: where are votes still being counted? a: most states have yet to report official results, meaning they are counting absentee or mail ballots or, more likely, deciding whether to count provisional ballots. those often are cast by voters whose names did not appear on registration lists or who may have voted in the wrong place or lacked proper identification. q: why does it take so long? a: millions of ballots come in at the last second -- or, in states that allow it, several days after the election with the proper postmarks. it takes money, manpower and accurate voting machines to get every vote counted correctly. ""we vastly underfund the way in which we run our elections,"" says michael mcdonald, a university of florida associate professor who maintains a website on the electoral system. ""the bottom line is that you want to get the count right."" q: how close are the two candidates in key battleground states? a: three thousand votes are all that separate clinton and trump in new hampshire. the margin is about 12,000 in michigan, 27,000 in wisconsin, 68,000 in pennsylvania and 113,000 in florida -- close, but nothing compared with the 537 votes that separated george w. bush and al gore in florida 16 years ago. q: can the votes be recounted? a: several states, including pennsylvania and florida, require the vote difference between the two candidates to be less than one-half of 1 percentage point. in michigan, a recount is triggered automatically if the margin is less than 2,000 votes. none of those states is close enough at the moment. q: is it possible that provisional and absentee voting results vary significantly from election day? a: yes, but it's unlikely. despite changes in voting laws in some states that civil rights groups claim unfairly restrict minorities, the poor and elderly, provisional votes that are accepted usually don't alter the results. ""the chances of changing tens of thousands of votes? that's just not going to happen,"" says hans von spakovsky, a former federal election commission member at the conservative heritage foundation. q: what's the deal in california? a: it's the largest state, and it has some of the most permissive voting procedures. more than half the state's votes are cast by absentee ballot, since no excuses are necessary to avoid going to a polling place on election day. provisional ballots are treated more leniently than in many other states, requiring time to correct mistakes that otherwise would cause votes to be rejected. q: when will the results be official? a: eight states have certified their results; an additional four are due to do so tuesday. nearly all will complete their counts by dec. 13, in time for the meeting dec. 19 of the electoral college -- the 538 individuals who, usually without exception, vote according to the results in each state",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Is it really over?

" it notched a stock market-style superfecta, with all four major u.s. stock indexes -- representing blue chip names, technology stocks, small caps and large-company stocks -- all closing at record highs on the same day for the first time in 17 years. the post-election rally began two weeks ago when ""red stocks"" ripped higher after republican donald trump's win nov. 8. the rally, which has been fueled by hopes that the president-elect's growth-friendly policies will finally jolt the u.s. economy out of its multiyear doldrums, has spread to virtually every corner of the stock market. all-time highs were in abundance to start the week: blue chips in the dow jones industrial average closed up 89 points to a record 18,956.69, extending its 2016 gain to nearly 9%. the benchmark standard & poor's 500 finished 0.8% higher at 2198.18, its highest close ever. the tech-packed nasdaq composite rallied 0.9% to a record 5368.86. and the russell 2000, a stock index filled with the market's smallest companies, extended its winning streak to 12 sessions on its way to an all-time record close of 1322.23 and a 16.4% gain for the year. that is the russell 2000's longest winning streak since june 2003. ""it is the first time the s&p 500, dow, russell 2000 and nasdaq all closed at a new high on the same day since dec. 31, 1999,"" says ryan detrick, senior market strategist at lpl financial. the surge in stock prices is driven by hopes that trump's plans to slash taxes, rid businesses of costly rules and regulations and spend billions to fix the nation's crumbling roads and bridges will produce a spike in economic growth sizable enough to put even more americans to work, put more cash in their pockets and boost the profitability of u.s. companies of all shapes, sizes and specialties. ""the stock market is viewing the new (trump) administration as friendly toward business,"" says bruce bittles, chief investment strategist at baird. ""this is 180 degrees from what markets have experienced the past eight years. it is a vote of confidence for the new administration."" bittles says stocks are also getting a boost from a massive shift of investors' cash from bonds to stocks and a tailwind from the seasonally bullish part of the year. ironically, the stock rally comes when headwinds that would normally spook markets have popped up. the federal reserve, for example, has all but said it will increase short-term interest rates for the first time this year when it meets in mid-december. the prospect of a fed hike is already causing bond investors to bail out of long-term u.s. government bonds, pushing yields on the 10-year treausry note back above 2.3% to a nearly one-year high. trump's plans to cut taxes and spend billions on infrastructure could nudge inflation and the u.s. budget deficit higher. that expected reaction caused traders to push the value of the u.s. dollar up vs. a basket of foreign currencies for 10 straight sessions before the greenback retreated monday. a stronger dollar hurts u.s. multinationals as it makes products sold abroad more expensive, pressuring their sales and profits. what's more, all of the gains have come before a single one of trump's policies has been implemented. trump won't even take over the white house until after inauguration day on jan. 20. the so-called trump rally will need to move from ""hope"" to real policies that move the economic needle in a positive direction, says michael cuggino, president and portfolio manager at permanent portfolio funds.

" one officer died and three were injured in the sunday attacks in san antonio, st. louis and gladstone, mo., and sanibel, fla. san antonio police chief william mcmanus said monday evening that otis tyrone mccain, 31, was arrested without incident in the sunday night killing of detective benjamin marconi. he was arrested around 4:30 p.m. monday after the car he was driving was stopped on interstate 10. ""police officers are doing their jobs the best they can, sometimes heroically, but now more than ever this kind of violence is in the back of their minds,"" james pasco, executive director of the national fraternal order of police, told usa today. pasco says that, while no direct connection linking sunday's shootings is apparent, social media can spread information -- often incorrect information -- quickly and widely and can provoke action. pasco says a drumbeat of criticism from the media, politicians and activists has eroded the esteem granted to law enforcement from the public. ""and when cops aren't safe, nobody is safe,"" he said. sunday's incidents occurred as tensions over police-linked shootings have flared nationwide. in july, five officers were killed in dallas by a heavily armed sniper who opened fire at a peaceful protest against police-involved shootings. in baton rouge less than two weeks later, three officers were killed and three others wounded in an ambush. in san antonio, mcmanus said the death of marconi during an otherwise routine traffic stop near the police station was more than a random act. ""i feel we (police) were targeted,"" mcmanus said. ""i think the uniform was the target."" he said marconi, 50, was conducting the traffic stop outside police headquarters just before noon when he was shot in his car while writing a ticket. mcmanus said a black male with a goatee drove up in a mitsubishi galant, walked up to marconi's car and shot the 20-year department veteran in the head before reaching in and shooting him again. the shooter then drove off, mcmanus said. the driver of the vehicle who had been stopped had no role in the tragedy, he said. mcmanus said the suspect briefly visited the police station four hours before the shooting, speaking to a desk clerk. he said the dashcam video provided ""a lot of information,"" but he provided no details. texas gov. greg abbott issued a statement asking everyone in texas to pray for the marconis' loved ones as they deal with ""this unimaginable tragedy."" abbott urged the legislature to pass his police protection act, which would classify attacks against law enforcement as hate crimes. pasco agreed, and said his organization will press congress in 2017 to add attacks on officers to the federal hate crimes statute. ""it should be wrong to attack somebody based on the color of their uniform,"" pasco said. in st. louis, a 46-year-old police sergeant who was shot twice in the face sunday evening was released from the hospital monday, chief sam dotson said. dotson said the officer was sitting in his cruiser in traffic when he was shot by someone in a nearby car. the 19-year-old suspect was killed hours later in a shootout with officers. dotson said the teen may have been connected to several robberies, a carjacking and a homicide. in gladstone, an officer was shot after a passenger ran from a car stopped for a traffic violation, according to kansas city police, which handled the investigation. the suspect, described as a white male in his late teens, pulled out a gun and was killed in the ensuing shootout that left one officer wounded. the officer was expected to make a full recovery. in florida, an officer was in his patrol car wrapping up a routine traffic stop at about 8 p.m. sunday when he was shot by someone driving by. the city said on its website that the suspect was taken into custody a short time later after exchanging gunfire with police. the wounded officer was treated at a hospital and released. contributing: ksdk-tv, st",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"Bloody day for cops shakes community; A troubling sign of the times, police union rep says",11/22/16

""whether it's producing steel, building cars or curing disease, i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, on our great homeland: america -- creating wealth and jobs for american workers,"" trump said in the video, his first address since his acceptance speech on election night. by posting the video on youtube rather than making a personal appearance, he didn't have to answer follow-up questions, and his aides could manage how he is portrayed, rather than relying on independent news media. ""our transition team is working very smoothly, efficiently and effectively,"" trump said in the video. ""truly great and talented men and women, patriots indeed, are being brought in, and many will soon be a part of our government, helping us to make america great again."" the meetings incoming presidents hold to consider cabinet and senior administration posts are often done in secrecy to avoid potential embarrassment for those who are passed over. trump is a candidate who's rejected the norms of campaign tradition, so it's not surprising he may govern the same. his team is trying to counteract the notion that he is rewarding loyalists vs. selecting the most qualified candidates to fill his cabinet. allowing the media to document a diverse array of contestants could be beneficial to that end. it's unknown whether he'll embrace a ""team of rivals"" approach by elevating his former foes. trump had more meetings monday, including one with rick perry. the former governor of texas and ex-rival in the republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in trump's cabinet, including the departments of defense, veterans affairs, energy and agriculture. that's after a weekend meeting with the 2012 republican nominee, mitt romney, who was harshly critical of trump during the entire election process but who may be under consideration for secretary of state. the president also met with a fairly prominent democrat: u.s. rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii, who backed bernie sanders over hillary clinton during the democratic primaries. a military veteran, gabbard has been a vocal critic of va medical services. in a statement released monday gabbard said, ""while the rules of political expediency would say i should have refused to meet with president-elect trump, i never have and never will play politics with american and syrian lives",NEWS; Pg. 5A,USA TODAY,"Trump on Cabinet: 'We've made a couple of deals'; On YouTube video, he talks about weekend spent meeting with 'patriots'",11/22/16

" a 2008 pentagon inspector general report singled out the marine corps combat development command, which mattis commanded during 2005, for its role in failing to act on an urgent plea for mine resistant ambush protected (mrap) vehicles to replace vulnerable humvees. in 2007, usa today reported there was a months-long delay in fielding mraps. those trucks, which have v-shaped hulls that deflect bomb blasts, eventually replaced nearly every humvee in iraq and afghanistan after defense secretary robert gates made them the pentagon's no. 1 priority. gates did so after reading in usa today about their superior protection over humvees against roadside bombs. instead of acting on the plea from marines in 2005, the command under mattis accepted the marine corps commandant's decision to replace its poorly protected humvees with better armored ones, the inspector general determined. the request for mraps languished. ""in reaction, the marine corps combat development command stopped processing (the urgent request) for mrap-type vehicle capability in august 2005,"" the inspector general found. the inspector general's report did not mention mattis by name, just that he was head of the combat development command at the time of the request. mattis, the report said, was asked on march 29, 2005, at a marine safety board meeting to review the feasibility of acquiring mraps, but that review was never conducted. command officials failed to develop a course of action for the urgent request for mraps, seek funding for them or appeal to another marine corps body to field them, the inspector general wrote. finally, the command ""did not, as it could and should have in july 2005,"" request that marine commanders take the request to the joint chiefs of staff ""to address an immediate and apparent joint war fighter need for an mrap-type vehicle capability."" mattis said in an interview with the inspector general's team that he directed that work continue to fulfill the urgent request and that he did not know why the work was not performed. pentagon officials knew long before 2005 about the humvee's vulnerabilities. their flat bottoms transmitted the force of blasts from improvised explosive devices (ieds) buried in roads directly to the troops they carried. military officials declared them a ""death trap"" in such attacks as early as 1994. by 2003, pentagon analysts were writing to the joint chiefs of staff about the superiority of mraps to humvees. one pentagon analyst complained april 29, 2004, in an email to colleagues that it was ""frustrating to see the pictures of burning humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that would provide more protection."" shortly after the invasion of iraq in 2003, ieds became the insurgents' weapon of choice and the no. 1 killer of american troops. officials in the marines and army resisted mraps, hulking, expensive vehicles. gates changed that in 2007 and launched a $50 billion program to outfit troops in combat with the superior protection offered by mraps. mattis declined requests for interviews, according to marlon bateman, a spokesman for the hoover institution where mattis is a fellow. the marines' urgent request for mraps was submitted in february 2005. ""mrap vehicles will protect marines, reduce casualties, increase mobility and enhance mission success,"" the request read. ""without mrap, personnel loss rates are likely to continue at their current rate."" as u.s. involvement in the wars in iraq and afghanistan wound down, the value of mraps became clear",NEWS; Pg. 5A,USA TODAY,"Mattis, Marines balked on MRAPs; Lifesaving combat vehicles delayed for months in Iraq",11/22/16
" the budding trump administration so far has been short on policy specifics. but just two days after the election, automakers' chief lobbying group, the alliance of automobile manufacturers, urged the trump transition team to revise not only the fuel economy standards, but also the obama administration's autonomous vehicle standards, on the grounds that they could cost its member companies billions of dollars. ""the short answer is that we don't know what will happen with the trump administration and electric vehicles,"" said dave reichmuth, senior engineer for the union of concerned scientists clean vehicles program. ""it might be awhile before we understand the policy priorities for the new administration."" reichmuth points out that the ev tax credit is embedded in the larger federal tax code, so removing it would require action from congress. so it's not likely to be changed soon, even if that was the direction that was chosen. it's worth noting that many of the cars receiving the credit come from u.s. assembly lines -- tesla in fremont, calif., the volt and bolt in the detroit area  and the nissan leaf in smyrna, tenn. none of this will shake automakers' resolve to advertise and sell these plug-in vehicles. the bolt ev comes off a week when it won two car of the year awards, one from motor trend, the second from green car journal. its certified 238-mile range on a full charge should ease consumers' anxiety about being stranded. the bolt comes to market, beginning in california, at least one year ahead of the tesla model 3. both are in the same price range -- about $30,000 or slightly less after the $7,500 federal tax credit. ""we have six now, and four are already sold. mid-december is the target week for when we get any more,"" said brian satterlund, new car sales manager at ron tonkin chevrolet in portland, ore., which has more public charging stations per capita than any u.s. city. about 1,100 miles south in redwood city, calif., about 40 customers have preordered bolts, according to michael little, a sales consultant at boardwalk chevrolet. ""those people have paid a $1,000 deposit that holds your place in line,"" little said. ""we're expecting to receive 39 bolts the week of nov. 28 and another 14 on dec. 12."" despite the turmoil in washington, d.c., the west coast remains a strong market for evs. california alone accounted for 54.5%, or 62,119, of the plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2015, according to hybridcars.com. the nation's largest state also has its own ev tax credits -- $2,500 for battery electrics and $1,500 for plug-in hybrids. dan sperling, founding director of the university of california-davis institute for transportation studies, said the industry's letter to the trump transition team should not be interpreted as a plea to drop emission or fuel economy standards altogether. these are global companies, and china and europe are moving forward with their incentives for non-gas-burning vehicles. whatever the trump administration does, the rest of the world won't abandon the paris agreement to reduce the global growth of carbon emissions.

" since 2012, 90 age-related lawsuits have been filed against a dozen top tech companies in silicon valley, according to the california department of fair employment and housing (dfeh), which provided the list of actions to usa today. the suits were filed  in california, where the companies are based and a vast majority of their employees are located. with 28 such suits since may 2013, hewlett-packard is most likely to spend the most time in court. cisco systems is named as defendant in 11 suits, followed by apple (nine), google (eight) and oracle and genentech (seven each). yahoo, intel, linkedin, facebook, tesla motors and twitter were also sued. most claim wrongful termination, while a smattering cited hiring or promotion. plaintiffs' names were omitted because the dfeh, a state civil rights agency, does not provide them to third parties. the rash of suits isn't surprising to those in silicon valley. legal experts and employees say a confluence of factors have deepened the problem: an aging workforce that wants to, and has to, work longer; a spike in mergers and restructurings that have led companies to shed workers; and evolving skill sets that have marginalized some workers and put a premium on others. layoffs, reorganizations and revamped performance reviews are often reasons for the lawsuits, a residue of an increase in mergers and acquisitions over the last few years that have created ""massive redundancy requiring consolidation,"" says dan mccoy, co-chair of the employment practices group at fenwick & west, a law firm in silicon valley. ""an aging workforce has made this a concern for employees,"" mccoy says. the onus in such suits is on the plaintiff, who has to prove deliberate intent on the behalf of employers. the spate of suits are a reminder that silicon valley's tendency to celebrate youth and newness can  veer into charges of discrimination based on age. it's a problem that could deepen as companies pursue m&a activity and spin-offs that force big changes in workforces and job requirements. as established firms such as hp, oracle and cisco snap up specialized companies to expand their business in newer fields such as cloud computing, the internet of things and augmented reality, they increasingly face the tricky task of streamlining operations and re-evaluating which employees to retain. the suits are also a reminder that youth is celebrated at large companies, start-ups and venture capitalist firms. most won't discuss the topic of how these shifts impact the average age of their employees. hewlett packard offers a prime example. it has laid off 85,000 people since 2012 after reorganizations and splitting into two companies, hewlett packard enterprise and hp inc., in 2015. descendant hpe also made some acquisitions, agreeing to pay $275million for sgi, a play on big-data analytics, and buying analytics start-up rasa networks. four former hp employees claim age discrimination in a lawsuit filed in august that alleges they were purged unfairly as part of a major restructuring involving tens of thousands of layoffs. the proposed class-action suit, filed in u.s. district court in san jose on aug. 18, claims the technology giant ""made it a priority to transform itself from an 'old' company into a 'younger' operation."" the plaintiffs -- donna forsyth, 62, of washington; sidney staton, 54 of california; arun vatturi, 52, of california; and dan weiland, 63, of texas -- say they were laid off when hp instituted a workplace reduction plan that allegedly targeted older workers after the computer services and printer maker announced 27,000 jobs cuts in 2012, the lawsuit says. next year, google faces a scheduled trial alleging age bias in hiring. ""how does age factor into one's googleyness? plaintiffs cheryl fillekes and robert heath allege that it plays a significant role,"" begins a lawsuit, filed in federal court in san jose in october, citing the federal age discrimination in employment act. hp and google  have denied the claims. cisco and facebook had no comment. oracle declined comment because it says it's in a quiet financial period. adam boettiger, a 50-year-old military veteran in portland, ore., says he was one of the first people to specialize in digital marketing in the 1990s. but over the last few years, it has gotten tougher for him to find a job. ""i'm now unemployable in an industry i helped create, which is very, very troublesome,"" says boettiger, who has applied for 125 jobs in marketing and e-commerce over the past few months. ""i'm often told i have too much experience. they rarely give any feedback, probably out of fear of being sued."" ""i feel it every day, but it's subtle,"" says jeanne locke alford, 59, a communications specialist for 35 years based in daly city, calif. ""it's not overt, but decisions are made before the first question is raised in a job interview. ""the issue will continue to grow, with baby boomers getting older and more people working longer because they can't afford to retire early."" for nearly two decades, zabeen ismail-youngs said she was a valued quality-assurance employee at genentech. she earned stellar reviews and numerous awards. then she got sick, old -- and was fired, she claims. when ismail-youngs was diagnosed with breast cancer at  47 in march 2012, the south san francisco, calif.-based biotech company decided she wasn't as valuable anymore, she says. her job was terminated nine months later. ""cancer wasn't too hard for me, but losing my job was,"" says ismail-youngs, now 52 and living in sausalito. ""i was a good person and i put so much heart and soul into my work. my heart sunk"" when i was laid off, she said. she did not sue genentech because, she said, she was too sick. ""genentech is proud to hire people of many different ages, experiences and backgrounds based on their qualifications and how their skills match a given position,"" genentech said in a email statement to usa today. ""the majority of genentech employees are over the age of 40."" the median age of an american worker is 42. at facebook it's 29, google 30, apple 31, amazon 30 and microsoft 33, according to research firm payscale. changing times and strategies often require changing job skills. some longtime employees say they have transitioned as well, and shrug off concerns of ageism.

" donald trump, despite having received classified briefings on the russian cyber threat, has refused to accept the intelligence community's judgment that such an attack took place. if obama does not act in his final weeks, it is a virtual certainty that president trump will not act either. as the beneficiary of the hacking, and as an admirer of russian strongman vladimir putin, trump would have every reason to let it slide. options for a response have already been outlined in a paper that has made its way to obama's desk. they are, of course, top secret, but last month vice president biden told nbc's meet the press that we would be ""sending a message"" to putin ""under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact."" all talk that was tough talk, but an unfortunate axiom applies to the obama administration: the tougher the talk, the lower the likelihood commensurate action will follow. that rule is especially likely to pertain in this instance because all the imaginable options are so unattractive. among other capabilities, the pentagon's cyber command or the cia's center for cyber intelligence could send signals into russian computers that could wreak destruction. already back in the cold war, the cia planted ""trojan horse"" computer chips in turbine technology the kgb was stealing from the west to control the flow of natural gas in siberian pipelines. the result was the largest non-nuclear explosion ever seen from outer space. we could undoubtedly repeat such a feat with the right sequence of key strokes on a laptop at cia headquarters, causing major pieces of russia's infrastructure to fail catastrophically. but the russians could retaliate just as easily, and they probably would. given how computerized our economy is, we stand to lose a lot more than we would gain. mutual assured destruction applies to the cyber age just as it did (and does) in the nuclear age. another alternative is to make public some portion of the enormous trove of documents the cia undoubtedly possesses that demonstrate massive corruption by putin and his cronies. but every russian already knows they have pillaged the country's treasure for personal gain. the major effect of such a u.s. action would be to induce a collective yawn. indictments? sanctions? both have been employed in response to past bouts of north korean and chinese hacking, and both would induce more yawns. moreover, whatever punitive economic measures obama puts in place today, president trump could reverse jan. 20. unless we settle for some petty retaliatory hacking of little moment, it would seem that we're out of tricks. the russian candidate still, even if there is no effective means of retaliation, there remains one thing obama must do. the russia-wikileaks assault on our electoral process was one of the most consequential influence operations in modern history. the public deserves a full accounting of what happened. the intelligence community should lay out what it knows. even if this means disclosing sensitive sources and methods, a timeline, a list of players, a description of the technology involved and any and all relevant evidence should be put into the public domain in a report prepared and signed by trusted blue-ribbon names. if we do not obtain a documented account before inauguration day, the incoming trump administration will have every incentive to erase the evidentiary trail. trump has exhibited no compunctions about falsifying far more trivial things. his designated national security adviser, retired lieutenant general michael flynn, is a brazen putinophile who has taken money from rt, moscow's principal english-language propaganda organ. flynn will only be too happy to go along. as we draw closer to the moment trump takes the oath of office, the american people deserve an accounting that clears up as thoroughly as possible all questions about one of the many extraordinary aspects of the 2016 presidential campaign: how a candidate favored by russia, and who favors russia, was helped by russia to ascend to the most powerful position in the world",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Spill details on Russia email hack; Public deserves fast, full accounting of stunning election interference",11/22/16
" an economist from rome worried about the ways in which skyrocketing economic inequality was fueling these trends. a sociologist from paris observed how rising islamophobia was driving young women in france to take up arms with the islamic state terrorist group. a former italian ambassador fretted about the growing influence worldwide of ""peddlers of reactionary utopias."" everyone at this meeting, sponsored by the italian non-profit reset, seemed fearful that hardening ethnic and religious identities were threatening such longstanding democratic values as freedom of the press and respect for the rule of law. it was, in short, an old-fashioned freakout among progressive scholars and journalists who had already suffered through their own elections of trump-like figures. i refused to join in the pity party. i had just written a book about how liberals almost always win america's culture wars. and i had been following closely the prognostications of a hillary clinton victory. so i told my colleagues that the united states was different. i was wrong. as of nov. 9, the united states is part of a global pandemic of majoritarian anti-politics that threatens to undo longstanding global commitments to religious pluralism and the rights of ethnic and racial minorities. so much for american exceptionalism. it is tempting to assign local causes to what historians will likely categorize as one of the most shocking political events in modern u.s. history, but the fact that donald trump is but one puffed-up strongman among many cries out for more global analysis. the most obvious cause of their rise with empty promises is the new global economy, which has sent factories and  workers packing and brought on unprecedented economic inequality. but this cause is intimately tied up with another: the rise of religious and ethnic nationalisms as easy antidotes to the anxiety and anger brought on by the jarring dislocations (and migrations) of this new global order. trumpism and brexit are  rejections of global trade, but they are also efforts to pull up the drawbridges and wall off outsiders. before nov. 8, european and asian nations wrestling with their own flirtations with majoritarianism and illiberal democracy were looking to the u.s. as a beacon of democratic values. now when people look to what president reagan proudly described as a ""shining city upon a hill,"" what they see is a dark and unexceptional america getting in line behind the vulgarities of philippine president rodrigo duterte and the naked aggression of russian president vladimir putin. at least for now, the united states is no longer the foremost defender of western civilization. it is its greatest threat",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Oh well, so much for American exceptionalism",11/22/16
" house democratic leader nancy pelosi has pledged to ""work together"" with the trump administration to ""quickly pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill."" the problem with politically created infrastructure jobs is that there is little evidence that more infrastructure spending is a good way to boost the economy or promote job growth. in reality, these projects often fail to deliver on  gains while costs spiral out of control, leading oxford university economic geographer bent flyvbjerg to propose the iron law of megaproject management: ""over budget, over time, under benefits, over and over again."" under federal grants, expansions are prioritized over routine maintenance, which is generally ineligible for federal funding. as a result, states and municipalities chasing federal dollars have an incentive to gold-plate projects in an attempt to grab as much ""free"" money as possible. lobbying is also a factor. the construction industry has an incentive to warn of doom and gloom over our  infrastructure. but what the infrastructure lobby doesn't say is that the number of structurally deficient bridges has been steadily declining for 25 years, according to the bureau of transportation statistics. the same goes for the improving pavement quality of  major highways. most of the infrastructure problems exist in  cities, where regional and municipal leaders have allowed mass transit systems, water and wastewater networks, airports and local streets to decay over the years. instead of expecting washington to bail them out of their provincial troubles, americans should demand that their local leaders stop creating local infrastructure problems in the first place. the notion that federal infrastructure spending isn't an economic panacea won't appeal to politicians more interested in claiming credit than solving problems. but if they want to support infrastructure improvements that can do real good, responsible politicians need to think and act locally",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Infrastructure spending myth,11/22/16

(she also has a pretty singing voice, one that bewitches hughes.) the youngsters don't spend as much time together as you'd hope: personal issues have marla reconsidering her life apart from frank, while he gets embroiled in hughes' tumultuous business dealings. beatty is entertainingly weird as hughes, nailing the rich man's storied idiosyncrasies: skulking around in the shadows, not wanting to meet with an increasingly frustrated businessman (oliver platt), sharing hamburgers with frank in front of his airplane and having tv dinners in an expensive bungalow with marla. he has great chemistry with both ehrenreich and collins, though beatty's character, while fun to watch, tends to slow down the plot in key places. the filmmaker has rounded up an impressive supporting cast, recruiting his wife, annette bening (as marla's uptight mom), plus candice bergen, martin sheen, ed harris and dabney coleman. broderick really shines in this group of big-screen stalwarts -- his levar acts as the voice of reason for frank amid hughes' stormy sea of crazy. beatty is as confident and stylish a filmmaker as he was on dick tracy, reds and his other directorial efforts, but rules just never comes together as  it should. the goofy comedy doesn't jibe with the more serious themes of religion, family, teen pregnancy and casual sexism (a product of the time), and the shifting relationship dynamics between marla, frank and hughes complicate matters",LIFE; Pg. 5D,USA TODAY,'Rules Don't Apply' to Warren Beatty's bizarre jaunt,11/22/16

" dementia rates in people older than  age 65 fell from 11.6% in 2000 to 8.8% in 2012, a decline of 24%, according to a study of more than 21,000 people across the usa published monday in jama internal medicine. ""it's definitely good news,"" said  kenneth langa, a professor of internal medicine at the university of michigan and a co-author of the  study. ""even without a cure for alzheimer's disease or a new medication, there are things that we can do socially and medically and behaviorally that can significantly reduce the risk."" as many as  5 million americans today suffer from dementia, a number that is expected to triple by 2050, as people live longer and the elderly population increases. the decline in dementia rates translates to about 1  million fewer americans suffering from the condition, said john haaga, director of behavioral and social research at the national institute on aging, part of the national institutes of health, which funded the  study. dementia is a general term for a loss of memory or other mental abilities that is severe enough to interfere with daily life. alzheimer's disease, which is believed to be caused by a buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain, is the most common type of dementia. vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia and occurs after a stroke. the new research confirms the results of several other studies that also have found steady declines in dementia rates in the united states and europe. the findings provide some of the strongest evidence yet for a decline in dementia rates because of its broad scope and diverse ranges of incomes and ethnic groups, haaga said. the average age of participants in the study, called the health and retirement study, was 75. the study, which began in 1992, focuses on people older than age 50, collecting data every two years. researchers conduct detailed interviews with participants about their health, income, cognitive ability and life circumstances. while advocates for people with dementia welcomed the news, they noted that alzheimer's disease and other forms of memory loss remain a serious burden for the nation and the world. the number of americans older than 65 is expected to nearly double by 2050, reaching 84million, according to the u.s. census. so even if the percentage of elderly people who develop dementia is smaller than previously estimated, the total number of americans suffering from the condition will continue to increase, said keith fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach, medical and scientific relations at the alzheimer's association. ""alzheimer's is going to remain the public health crisis of our time, even with modestly reduced rates,"" fargo said. although researchers can't definitively explain why dementia rates decreased, langa said doctors may be doing a better job controlling high blood pressure and diabetes, which can both boost the risk of age-related memory problems. high blood pressure and diabetes both increase the risk of strokes, which kill brain cells, increasing the risk of vascular dementia. ""we've been saying now for several years that what's good for your heart is good for your head,"" fargo said. ""there are several things you can do to reduce your risk for dementia."" authors of the study found that senior citizens today are better educated than even half a generation ago. the population studied in 2012 stayed in school 13 years, while the seniors studied in 2000 had about 12 years of education, according to the study. that's significant, because many studies have found a strong link between higher educational levels and lower risk of disease, including dementia, lang said. the reasons may  be complex. people with more education tend to earn more and have better access to health care. they're less likely to smoke, more likely to exercise and less likely to be overweight. they also may live in safer neighborhoods and have less stress. people who are better educated may have more intellectually stimulating jobs and hobbies that help exercise their brains, langa said. it's also possible that people with more education can better compensate for memory problems as they age, finding ways to work around their impairments, according to an accompanying editorial by ozioma okonkwo and  sanjay asthana of the university of wisconsin school of medicine and public health. yet americans shouldn't expect dementia rates to continue falling indefinitely, haaga said. although educational levels increased sharply after world war ii, those gains have leveled off, haaga said.

" that's because we learn next to nothing about how the economy is really doing from the initial reports of how retailers fared on black friday. at least since the 1930s, the day after thanksgiving has been considered the beginning of the christmas shopping season. since at least the 1960s it has been referred to as ""black friday."" in recent years, as much as one quarter of the total annual sales of the typical u.s. retailer occur in the four-week period between then and christmas. given this outsized importance of the holiday shopping season and the role consumer expenditures play in the overall economy, you'd think it would be crucial for investors to keep close tabs on how the season is kicking off. but the data tell another story. consider the stock market's performance over the two trading days after thanksgiving -- black friday and the subsequent monday. (this monday in recent years has come to be known as cyber monday, reflecting the growing proportion of holiday sales made online.) by the end of monday's session, of course, investors will have had access to retailers' initial estimates of their black friday sales volumes. if those estimates are particularly rosy, the stock market typically finishes that monday higher than where it stood before turkey day -- and vice versa. yet more often than not, the stock market reverses that two-day trend and does just the opposite through the end of the year. a particularly stark illustration of this trend reversal came in november and december 2008, during the dark days of the financial crisis. initial reports were that retailers' black friday and cyber monday sales were particularly disappointing, and the dow plunged by 6.6% over those two days. nevertheless, from then through the end of the year, the dow rose 7.7%. not every year has seen such significant trend reversals. but in those years since the early 1930s in which that two-day trend was down, the dow jones industrial average gained 2.1% from then until new year's, on average. that contrasts with a gain of 1.7% when the stock market rose over the two days after thanksgiving. to be sure, a 0.4 percentage- point difference is not very large. but no one is suggesting that you actually become more bullish if the initial black friday retail reports are disappointing. the investment implication of the data is instead that you should simply ignore those reports. if you nevertheless insist on making a short-term trade around thanksgiving, the bet that enjoys the strongest statistical support is that the stock market will be higher at the end of the first week of december than where it stands on the monday before thanksgiving. this two-week period represents the confluence of two seasonal patterns that researchers have detected in the historical record: strength over the two trading sessions prior to an exchange holiday and strength around the turn of the month. over the last century, for example, the stock market has risen about two-thirds of the time over these two weeks. that's markedly better than the 54% odds of rising that prevail for all other comparable periods of the calendar. notice carefully, however, that this means stocks still fall one out of three times over these pre- and post-thanksgiving sessions. for most investors, therefore, the best advice is to focus on buying and holding good quality stocks for the long term -- and enjoying thanksgiving dinner without worrying about the stock market's short-term gyrations. hulbert, founder of the hulbert financial digest, has been tracking investment advisers' performances for four decades. for more information, email him at mark@hulbertratings.com or go to www.hulbertratings",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,How to factor Black Friday into investment strategy; Initial reports may not tell you enough to make a good decision,11/22/16
" according to a recent cnet survey, one in four holiday  shoppers has been a victim of an online hack in the past 12 months. to avoid joining their number, cybersecurity experts offer these tips to keep you, your credit cards and bank accounts safe. 1.don't use sketchy wireless networks this is the easiest to fall for. you're out and about, you pull out your phone and up pops a free wi-fi hotspot. it might even have a safe-sounding name: westfield mall guest network, or holiday happiness free wi-fi. without thinking, you click and get connected. hackers get the chance to infect your phone with malware or siphon off your passwords and account information. there are a couple of issues there. sometimes the network is a fake one, what security professionals call a honeypot, meant to lure in the unsuspecting so their information can be stolen. to guard against these, look around for signs at the mall, store or airport that include the wi-fi network name, and make sure you're using that. don't just assume that any network that pops up is legitimate. hackers routinely create them and wait for the unwary to connect. ask an employee if you're not sure. when in doubt, don't connect. even if you are on a legitimate network, remember that public wi-fi isn't secure. it's all too easy for someone to monitor the traffic whizzing through the air and potentially steal login and password information that you yourself type in or that your phone automatically fills in through pre-existing cookies. ""consider waiting to enter your credit card information when you get home,"" suggests james lyne, global head of security research for sophos, a security firm. 2.who really sent you that online holiday card? electronic holiday cards are increasingly popular, but be careful about clicking on the links that show up in your mailbox. while we've become cautious of subject lines like ""help! stuck in the philippines"" or ""urgent: must move funds from romania,"" something that says ""merry christmas from the andersons"" might slip through our defenses. do you actually know any andersons? and didn't you already get a paper card from them last week? 3.use different passwords for each account yes, broken record time here. but criminal hackers really do keep searchable lists of all the account ids, email addresses and passwords they've stolen. they can even rent those lists for pennies for a thousand names. so when they break into one account, they add it to the database. then they try that same email address and password against a list of hundreds of other stores and banks. think of it as the lord of the rings maxim: one password to rule them all makes for bad security. if you can't remember all those passwords, consider using a password management program, suggests ey cybersecurity services. 4.watch for typo squatters we're all busy and trying to do a million things at once. which is why you should always take a second to look at the url you just typed into your browser and make sure you are where you think you are. cyber criminals know we make mistakes when we type, and they've registered a lot of typo-ridden addresses that are just a hair away from the one you meant to type. it could be something as simple as gooogle.com (though google long ago got most possible variations on its name, so this one's safe) or say auntsalliesteashop when the actual aunt sally spells hers with a y, not ie. criminals can almost perfectly copy the site they're aping, so you think you're where you want to be. double check. 5.change your coffee pot's password connectable devices will be a hot item this holiday season, whether they're coffee pots you can turn on with an app on your phone, a drone or a smart light bulb system. but they're also eminently hackable, and most come with laughably easy preset passwords that take hackers only a few seconds to get past. when you're setting up your new gadgets, take the extra five minutes to reset the password they came with so your device doesn't run the risk of becoming part of someone else's zombie botnet. 6.don't hand over your credit card number it's tempting to let a website keep your credit card number and information on file. but if that site gets breached and it hasn't done a good job of protecting yours and everyone else's credit card information, it could mean trouble. 7.read through your credit card bills if you see a charge you don't recognize, call immediately to check it out. too often hackers presume people won't notice the $40 here or $20 there on their cards and thereby miss fraudulent charges. get them reversed quickly so you don't have to pay. 8.take care on package delivery notices phishing emails that try to get you to click on a link that can install malicious software on your computer are a perennial problem. this year intel security says it has seen an uptick in fake delivery notices. these look like the common email notices sent out when something you've ordered online has been shipped. they might say, ""click here for expected delivery date,"" except they aren't from an actual store but instead from hackers",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,8 Tips on how to remain safe while CYBER shopping,11/22/16

" but that's actually just the beginning of a scenario that, if you work the angles, can save you a ton of money on vehicle ownership. data from edmunds.com puts first-year depreciation at almost 22% and roughly 12% annually in years two through four. taking an average midsize sedan as an example, with a selling price of about $24,000, that first-year depreciation drop means an initial loss of almost $5,300, and the car has lost about half its value by the end of year four. lease returns soaring this isn't good news for the new-car buyer. but the savvy used-car buyer can use this information to save money on both ends of the ownership cycle. furthermore, with the increasing popularity of two- and three-year leases, there's a flood of good used cars to choose from. used-car shoppers should try looking for 2- and 3-year-old cars coming off lease, says lisa rosenberg, an analyst for cargurus.com, a car shopping website that features 5 million new and used vehicles. cargurus data show a consumer could save at least $6,750 buying a 2-year-old formerly leased car, a 25% savings over a new model. additionally, a 2-year-old car will still be under factory warranty. buy and sell strategically tony hoang, head of vehicles at ebay motors, has a slightly different take. ""if you are looking to get a great value for non-luxury, midsize vehicles, (you) should purchase a used vehicle that's around a year old,"" he says. to sell that car ""strategically,"" hoang says to put it back up for sale after about four years since it still holds much of its value, based on the used purchase price. after the fifth year, the value begins to drop as the factory warranty expires and repairs and maintenance increase. putting it all together, if you buy a used car and drive it for three or four years, you'll get a modern set of wheels at a bargain price. edmunds estimates that the three-year depreciation cost of an average midsize sedan, bought at 1 to 2 years old, could be as low as $7,000, or about $2,333 each year. but hoang points out that each vehicle class has its own peculiarities when it comes to depreciation. for example, the market for midsize sedans is softening as the popularity of suvs and trucks increases. it's important to understand the effect of a car's depreciation on your automotive budget and that you pay dearly for that whiff of new-car smell. a chart of ownership expenses on kelley blue book shows depreciation is the single biggest expense, dwarfing the cost of fuel, insurance, registration, financing and maintenance. buying is easy buying a near-new car is easier than ever today, particularly if you take advantage of nationwide internet searches and online vehicle history reports. even interest rates for used cars have dropped, increasing the overall savings. concerns about buying a car sight unseen are addressed by a network of mobile inspectors such as wegolook.com, which recently teamed with ebaymotors to provide onsite inspections for $69. an oft-cited disadvantage of buying used is that you don't get the latest technology. however, many safety features, such as blind-spot warning and forward collision avoidance systems, have been on the market for several years and are now available in many used cars. choosing a car that depreciates slowly can save you thousands of dollars over a four-year ownership cycle. buying the car after it already has depreciated -- and selling it strategically -- reduces your costs even more. reed is a staff writer at nerdwallet, a personal finance website. email: preed@nerdwallet.com nerdwallet is a usa today content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the web",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,"TO SAVE BIG, FIND USED-CAR SWEET SPOT",11/22/16

" the key going forward will be for investors to build their portfolios so they can capture additional upside while being prepared for any more shocks. so far, there has been no question this market is headed higher. the dow jones industrial average is up 9% this year and doesn't appear to be running out of steam. the dow pierced 19,000 for the first time in history tuesday. analysts are calling for even more upside. if the price targets on the 30 stocks in the dow are correct, the market measure would be at more than 20,000 in 18 months. but investors need to appreciate that while bullishness rages, investors are assuming the best. much of the market's move upward is a pricing in of lighter regulation and more government spending. it's yet to be determined if wall street's bullish assumptions about economic growth actually pan out. meanwhile, serious headwinds persist, such as the strong dollar, which hurts u.s. exports. higher interest rates, too, could hurt real estate and private borrowing",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,"Yes, but dial back if not comfortable; Q: Can stocks continue to move higher?",11/23/16
" the potential for a rollback in regulation and a corporate tax rate of 15% are reasons the stock market has reacted so positively to trump's plans. but what about entrepreneurs and emerging businesses? will this area still be the growth story it has been? and where will the jobs and growth come from in coming years? i caught up with serial entrepreneur jessica herrin, ceo and founder of stella & dot (and before that weddingchannel.com in the 1990s). herrin has created what she calls a modern-day mary kay, where she relies on specialists or stylists to get her accessories to customers. our interview follows, edited for clarity and length. q: stella & dot is the second company you've created. how tough was it? a: i first started my career in technology and quickly realized  you could create professional success without really creating impact and happiness. and i became motivated to start another business that would really make a difference on something i was passionate about, and that was creating more flexible work for women. i began in my living room while i had another full-time job, and i was pregnant and wanted to reinvent what the on-the-go business opportunity could be for the modern woman that would be about great product, use of technology and really putting profits in your pocket by reinventing the model. q: tell us about stella & dot and how it works. a: stella & dot is a family of brands that has grown into two accessories brands, stella & dot and keep collective. and we're also a platform that launched a skincare brand.  with stella & dot, we've taken a couture design process and applied that to affordable luxury. so half of our product line is under $50, and it really is style made simple. our stylists are really a personal shopper that help girlfriends who get together and try it on at home, or shop online ... for that busy woman who wants to look pulled together but needs a little help. keep is a more memory-based line which makes the ultimate personalized gift and is  a keepsake. our skincare brand is creating a good-for-you product that gives results. q: you started the wedding channel back in the '90s. a: wedding channel had a very non-sexy start. i was working at a tech company that was bringing together price and availability information to help make assembling computers easier. i applied that basic thought to bring together the information of where people were registered for wedding gifts and make it easy for people to shop for that online. this was during the birth of e-commerce. so instead of having consumers go into a store, they could easily check out in minutes by searching a couple's name, finding the different stores they were registered in and purchase a wedding gift. so it was really about taking technology and creating a very simple solution to a large-market customer problem. q: a lot of people have great ideas, but they don't know how to execute them. a: i just wrote a book, find your extraordinary, that chronicles my entrepreneurial journey. and it really talks about the entrepreneurial spirit. because for most people, having an idea, or even access to capital, isn't enough. it's about the motivation and will to be tenacious enough to actually get an idea off the ground and turn it into a viable business. every overnight success story takes seven to 10 years. it's harder than you think. for me, i had to drop out of business school and raise venture capital, and that's how i started wedding channel. i was very convinced that i wanted to do stella & dot differently so that i could keep control of the mission and run the business for impact instead of profits. that meant that i had to bootstrap. i had another full-time job, and i didn't take a (stella & dot) paycheck for six years. you have to stick with it. it's about finding the right people that can partner with you, who are experts in the area that you need to know about. and then it's about being productive and getting the right things done. q: what about the money end of it? a: i went back to the people that had been on my board at wedding channel. that was productive because we had a working relationship, so they invested seed capital into this business. it's definitely a silicon valley anomaly that we spent $2 million to get to profitability. and that's compared to the hundreds of millions other companies of our size have raised, and they're not necessarily even at profitability yet. i wanted to fund the business off of sales growth and not be in the business of turning a dollar into a dime but really doing something  sustainable. and that took bootstrapping. it took a lot of sacrifice. but it was worth it because now our business isn't about who needs a liquidity event and who's trying to post profits for the quarter for wall street. it's truly about serving our business owners and making an impact on the workplace for women. q: what was the initial investment you received from outside investors? a: i had invested myself and was funding the business until i brought in partners. i think our seed round of capital was about $250,000. and that was maybe a year or so into the business when we already were generating about that much in revenue. as we went to grow and hire people, then we needed to raise another couple of million dollars. q: was it hard for you to accept that you aren't going to be the only sheriff in town? a: bringing in people and partners is essential for success. and i needed other people to care and have skin in the game. so i didn't think about it as giving up ownership. i thought about it as gaining another person who cared as much as i did about driving the business to succeed in order to serve the mission. and if you pick the right partners, you're gonna feel that way too. so to escalate my own commitment, i paced getting that investment around the birth of my two daughters and knowing that i was ready to commit to other people around the trajectory of the business. i've always looked at my partners as welcome seats at the table who care as much as i do and are equally responsible for creating the success. blythe harris, who's the chief creative officer, joined a couple years into the business and became a partner. she also invested in the business. and that was essential for our success. q:  tell us where the business is going. a: each of our three brands is only at the beginning stages of its market potential. we're very focused on broadening our impact on how many people we help earn flexible income, often on top of another full-time job.  so our focus is using our three brands in the six countries that we're in to capture all the untapped demand that's out there for the $30 billion accessory market in north america and the multibillion-dollar skincare market, where we feel we really have disruptive products people love. q: and the way you do it is different, sort of like a mary kay or an avon lady, right? a: we have a very modern approach to our business. our sellers drive their business through social media and mobile technologies as much as they do person-to-person contact. and we have a very pro-profit model for them in which there are no quotas; they're not carrying inventory. we ship direct to the customer. we offer free returns and guarantee  quality. so we really make this business something that works when they work it, and they can do that at their own pace. q: you are up to 500 employees at your home office a: yes, and just over 50,000 independent business owners that work across one of our family of brands. and we produce our goods in the u.s. and in asia. and it really depends on what type of artistry we're using. so you'll do embroidery in india. our skincare products are made and billed in the united states. and some of our jewelry is made in vietnam, china and thailand, based on skill. as an entrepreneur, you're not an expert in everything. but if you're a creator, you've got to be a connector of experts to your mission. so it's about going out and meeting as many people as you can and finding the best people that are experts in marketing or production or technology or whatever balance of skill you need as an entrepreneur. i really understood technology and company building and marketing and sales, but i needed someone to help with product design and production processes and (working with) individual business owners. so i went out and sought that expertise in partners. and then they had a network of people that were experts. q: do you expect the trump administration's economic plan to have an impact on your business? lower taxes and lower regulations? a: well, we're also potentially expecting tariffs to go up. so we're in a ""let's see what actually comes to fruition and gets put into law versus what might have been part of a campaign rhetoric"" mode. i believe in what we do and why we do it. i believe people need flexible income. so from our perspective, i'm optimistic about continued growth because we make great products and we do it for a great reason. from a general economy perspective, i believe when you lower corporate taxes you give businesses the ability to invest. so if businesses are operating responsibly and they're focused on job creation in the u.s., that will be good for the economy",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Herrin proudly promotes a workplace for women; Entrepreneur uses specialists to deliver accessories to clients,11/23/16
" speaking in a building named after ronald reagan a short distance from the white house, spencer declares that ""america was, until this past generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. it is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us."" images like this are jarring for a nation that lost 418,500 people in world war ii. a nation that saved the world from fascist tyranny. a nation that has made great strides in combating racism and anti-semitism in the years since. a nation whose strength lies in its diversity. that spencer would so closely channel adolf hitler -- at one point even using the german word lí_genpresse, or ""lying press,"" to describe reporters -- is beyond chilling. and what has donald trump, the object of these people's admiration, said in response? after the atlantic magazine released footage of the event on monday, the trump transition team said the president-elect ""continued to denounce racism of all kinds,"" without specifically mentioning spencer or his innocuously named national policy institute. at a meeting with the new york times on tuesday, trump did better, saying: ""i disavow and condemn them."" through actions and appointments as well as words, trump and his incoming team cannot distance themselves fast enough and far enough from these people. all presidents attract the support of fringe groups. president obama, for instance, won the backing of the socialist party usa. but rarely, if ever, has there been a group that sees in the election of a president more affirmation of its  cause than the national policy institute sees in trump's win. it is easy to understand why spencer would take this view. trump's  inner circle of advisers includes stephen bannon, who, as editor of the breitbart news site, provided a platform for alt-right provocateurs. and trump's  campaign broke ugly new ground in using race, religion and ethnicity to court white voters. it hardly requires an investigation, as trump suggested tuesday, to find out why white supremacists are ""energized"" by his victory. trump's behavior seems calculated to walk a fine line. on the one hand, he wants the support of voters who could be sympathetic to alt-right and white nationalist causes. on the other hand, he does not want to be too closely associated with them. that approach is doomed to fail. unless he actively, vehemently and repeatedly denounces the richard spencers of this world, they will continue to use his presidency to promote their odious agenda",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Nazi salutes near the White House,11/23/16
" two weeks have passed since an unusually ugly and divisive presidential campaign. many of the 70 million who voted for someone other than donald trump see the outcome as one of america's darker chapters. many of those who voted for trump are thrilled, but many others admit their choice was made more out of frustration than affirmation. and for millions of americans, just getting through the family dinner on thursday without a major blowup seems like a reach. in addition to the political worries, americans are vexed by global terrorism, concerned their jobs may disappear or worried about other matters. but, as always, there are reasons to be thankful, starting with family and health. beyond that, the past decade has seen remarkable breakthroughs in science and medicine, and substantial abatement of seemingly intractable problems. among the positive trends that don't often get the attention they deserve: the economy is doing well. negativity aside, the numbers on employment and economic growth are pretty good. since the bottom of the great recession, 15.2 million jobs have been created, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.9%. just last week, 235,000 people filed first-time unemployment claims. that's the lowest weekly figure in 43 years and marks the 89th straight week below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970. the biggest criticism of the economy -- that it isn't producing much wage growth -- is getting harder to defend. last year, annual median household income was up 5.2%, with all signs suggesting that the trend will continue into this year. even the poverty rate has been dropping. meanwhile, the stock market has been hitting new highs, bolstering americans' 401(k) accounts. isil is in retreat. the islamic state terrorist group, which uses iraq and syria as its base, is in decline in both countries. according to army lt. gen. sean macfarland, the top u.s. commander in the region, isil's numbers in those two countries have dropped from 60,000 to about 15,000. iraqi forces are battling to defeat the remaining isil fighters in mosul, their most significant holding in the country, while u.s.-backed forces in syria have made impressive strides there as well. no one expects isil to disappear. but denying its fighters a base from which to operate, and showing that they can be defeated, should greatly diminish the terror group's reach and appeal. teen smoking is down. smoking kills far more americans than terrorists do, and most smokers get addicted as youths. last year, smoking among high school students dropped to its lowest level in the quarter-century that data have been collected. the two years from 2013 to 2015 saw one of the steepest declines yet, as the 15.7% of students who smoked dropped to 10.8%, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. as recently as 1997, more than 36% of high school students smoked. the drops could portend a long-term improvement in the health of americans. however, the campaign against smoking is far from won. public health officials are still wary that e-cigarettes could help addict a new generation to nicotine. teen births continue to fall. just as teen smoking rates have declined, so have teen birth rates. last year, 22.3 children were born to every 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19. that's down by nearly half in eight years and a whopping 64% since 1991, when the teen birth rate was 61.8 per 1,000. the declines were across all categories, but were most pronounced in urban areas and among african americans and hispanics. in fact, teens in big cities are below the national average in having babies. experts cite birth control as the prime cause of the drop, though some preliminary evidence also suggests a drop in sexual activity. in any case, the declines mean an easier path to college and successful careers for young women, and fewer children raised by mothers who are ill-prepared for their responsibilities -- in other words, a win-win situation. divorce rates are down, too. divorce rates have dropped three years in a row and are at their lowest level in 35 years. from nearly 23 divorces per 1,000 married women in 1980, the rate fell below 17 in 2015, according to the national center for family & marriage research. the rate of marriages, meanwhile, ticked up slightly in 2015, continuing a modest upward trend following a long and steady decline. in 2015 there were 32.3 marriages per 1,000 adult unmarried women, up from 31.9 the previous year. the numbers on marriage and divorce are important because stable marriages are associated with other positive trends such as lower youth crime, more vibrant neighborhoods and greater educational attainment",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Amid rancor, reasons to give thanks; These five positive trends in America don't often get the attention they deserve",11/23/16
" some 48.7 million travelers will take a trip of at least 50 miles over the holiday, a 2% increase over last year, says aaa, the organization once known as the american automobile association. of those, 89% will be driving to their destinations. the average price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide averaged $2.132 tuesday, down from $2.225 a month ago but up from $2.078 a year ago, according to aaa's daily price tracking service. even diesel fuel prices remain low, averaging $2.384 a gallon, down from $2.442 a gallon a year ago. ""it's not going to be as cheap as thanksgiving weekend as last year, which was the cheapest since 2004,"" says tom kloza of the oil price information service, which keeps tabs on gasoline prices. but he says oil, from which gasoline is made, remains in a ""consistently cheap"" environment despite attempts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to re-establish control. opec's ability to impose higher prices, however, is being  hit by a resurgent oil industry in the u.s., which can put a lid on prices if they climb too high. u.s.-based airlines are counting on thanksgiving to be their busiest travel period ever, with a record 27 million fliers between last friday and nov. 29, according to their trade group, airlines for america. whether it's airports or highways, wednesday remains the big weekend getaway day. when it comes to traffic congestion, wednesday will  likely see the most big tie-ups, says waze, the crowd-sourced traffic and navigation app service. it says its users last year reported coming across 33% more traffic accidents, 26% more traffic hazards and 20% more traffic jams compared with the average over the four weeks prior",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,AAA: Thanksgiving travel will hit 9-year high,11/23/16

""i fully intend to vote for donald trump,"" said jim skaggs of bowling green, ky., one of that state's eight electors, who added that he really doesn't like trump. ""it's not a law, i don't think. ... but i think it's a duty."" he's right. kentucky is one of 28 states, according to the congressional research service and additional usa today research, that don't mandate their electors to vote for the winner of their state's popular vote. the constitution and federal law are silent on the matter. more than 4.5 million supporters have signed a change.org petition advocating electors' change of heart, but the desire is little more than a pipe dream, election experts said. two democratic electors in colorado and washington state, where clinton won the electoral votes and electors are obligated under state law to vote for her, have launched their own movement that they've dubbed ""moral electors"" to achieve the same result -- or more likely throw the decision to the house of representatives as happened in 1824. ""this is a long shot. it's a hail mary,"" p. bret chiafalo of everett, wash., told politico. ""however, i do see situations where -- when we've already had two or three (republican) electors state publicly they didn't want to vote for trump. how many of them have real issues with donald trump in private?"" where chiafalo sees a hail mary play, some trump electors consider the drama more as harassment. ""hillary's got a great campaign going,"" said sharon geise, an elector from mesa, ariz., who estimates 8,000 emails have flooded her inbox. ""it's the same thing, pretty much. basically: vote for hillary clinton. it's bizarre. i don't dare answer my phone."" a dozen letters urging her to back anybody but trump arrived at her home thursday. ""she has to stop all of this,"" geise said of clinton. ""this is ridiculous."" it's not clear whether clinton supports this movement. she conceded to trump on the day after the election, and president obama, who endorsed his former secretary of state, committed to a smooth transition of power. even delegations from states such as florida that can inflict penalties for voting by conscience instead of popular vote haven't escaped activists' barrage. in florida, a faithless elector would be charged with a misdemeanor, prohibited from casting an electoral college vote and replaced, presumably with an alternate more faithful to the popular-vote results in the state, said franita tolson, a voting rights law professor at florida state university. that elector's political future within the gop would be toast. historically, fewer than two electors per presidential election have changed their votes because they didn't want the candidate on whose slate they ran, according to fairvote.org, a district of columbia-based non-partisan, non-profit group. the most recent was in 2004 and might have been a mistake.

" lock her up."" what he didn't say was that, as president, he would not have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton, much less jail her, as trump threatened during a debate. that's the jurisdiction of the u.s. justice department, which is supposed to work outside the influence of politics. now that he's won the election, the president-elect appears to be sending a signal to congress and perhaps even his incoming attorney general that it's no longer politically beneficial to try to prosecute the former democratic presidential nominee. trump adviser kellyanne conway told msnbc that the president-elect hopes congress will forgo further investigations of clinton. ""i think when the president-elect, who's also the head of your party, tells you before he's even inaugurated that he doesn't wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone and content to the members"" of congress, conway told msnbc's morning joe. ""he was brilliant in neutralizing the harsh negative attitudes towards himself by making hillary clinton equally distasteful,"" said larry jacobs, a presidential historian at the university of minnesota. ""now he's shedding it once in office because it would hurt him."" the belief among trump's supporters that clinton was a criminal who would end up in jail was a powerful message in a campaign defined by harsh personal attacks more than policy differences. republican strategists said trump was never serious about putting his political opponent behind bars. ""to donald trump, it was more a chant to get her out of government,"" said brad blakeman, a former senior staff member to president george w. bush. indeed, legal experts had warned that, only under authoritarian regimes, can leaders unilaterally jail political dissidents and opponents, and especially not under the united states' carefully constructed democratic system of checks and balances and separation of powers. trump may risk angering some of his most enthusiastic backers, many of whom angrily taunted clinton's motorcade with signs reading ""lock her up"" in campaign stops across the country. judicial watch, a group that's pursued many investigations and lawsuits against the clintons, responded with dismay to the news. ""if mr. trump's appointees continue the obama administration's politicized spiking of a criminal investigation of hillary clinton, it would be a betrayal of his promise to the american people to 'drain the swamp' of out-of-control corruption in washington,"" judicial watch president tom fitton said in a statement. the investigation of clinton's private email server was an outgrowth of a special house committee to investigate the terror attacks in 2012 in benghazi, libya. house majority leader kevin mccarthy credited the inquiry with driving down clinton's poll ratings. the strategy became increasingly effective as republicans built up expectations that clinton would be indicted by the fbi. director james comey, a republican, determined that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would press criminal charges based on the evidence. while clinton enjoyed a sizable lead in head-to-head polls, republicans cried foul, and trump ramped up his complaints of a ""rigged system."" ""the investigation itself came out of a political atmosphere,"" said julian zelizer, a presidential expert at princeton university. ""it was just trumped up during the campaign itself. obviously, some of his supporters might be angry because they believed that chant. if he moves on to other issues, they will as well."" during the campaign, trump threatened clinton repeatedly with further investigation of her use of a private e-mail server as well as the fundraising practices of the clinton foundation. during one of their debates, trump told her, ""if i win, i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation further."" after the election, trump signaled he would not pursue  clinton or her husband, former president bill clinton. ""i don't want to hurt them,"" trump said this month on cbs' 60 minutes. ""they're good people. i don't want to hurt them."" conway told msnbc that  clinton ""still has to face the fact that a majority of americans don't find her to be honest or trustworthy,"" and ""if donald trump can help her heal, then perhaps that's a good thing to do."" jacobs said calling off congressional investigators is ""the right thing to do"" for trump",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Trump: Let Clinton email issue go; President-elect shifts from lock her up to leave her alone,11/23/16
"s. national anthem to show their unhappiness with the election of donald trump. the respectful reaction underscores a divide between what people think of america as opposed to what they think of the president-elect. mexicans embrace almost everything american -- from sipping starbucks coffee to shopping at walmart (the country's largest retailer) to watching netflix and nfl games. even thanksgiving dinners and eating american-style barbecue are catching on. ""the level of affluence (in the usa) is what's attractive to people,"" uber driver juan fernando flanes said. ""trends in the united states become trends here."" the affection for americana isn't extended to the president-elect: many mexicans greeted his victory with jeers and expletives. their anger is a reaction to his labeling of some mexicans who entered the usa illegally as criminals and ""rapists"" and his vows to deport millions of mexicans, build a wall along the border at mexico's expense and renegotiate the 1994 north american free trade agreement that has brought billions of dollars in investment. pre-election surveys showed huge increases in pro-u.s. sentiment over the past 15 years. the 2016 latinobarí_metro poll of latin american attitudes found 76% of mexicans had a favorable view of the usa. that compared with 15% with a negative view, the lowest level since 2000. ""the improvement in the image of the neighboring country has a lot to do with president obama, who mexicans hold in very high esteem,"" pollster alejandro moreno wrote in the newspaper el financiero. ""no national politician has an image as positive as obama,"" who has a favorable rating of 60%, compared with just 8% who view him unfavorably, moreno said. trump, by contrast, may start out as the least popular u.s. president since the 1840s, when james polk ordered the invasion of mexico, which cost the country its northern territory. the question is whether the new president will reverse mexicans' positive feelings about the usa and whether he can blunt growing trade between the two countries that has been so vital to mexico's well-being. its economy had once been so closed that imported candy bars were sold as contraband. now cross-border trade amounts to $1million every minute. millions have relatives living in the usa, and american culture is ever more appealing. american football is mexico's second-most-popular spectator sport, trailing only soccer. mexicans fly to dallas, houston and miami to attend nfl games. tickets for monday's game sold out immediately, and some went for as much as eight times their face value on the resale market. ""it's a way to show off your wealth,"" said esteban illades, editor of the mexican magazine nexos. mexico's growing numbers of affluent citizens have become obsessed with conspicuous consumption, he said. ""they want to live in a country where they can buy everything they want."" since trump's election, the peso has fallen to record lows against the dollar, which crimps mexicans' purchasing power. anti-trump protests haven't materialized as in europe. after getting over the shock of his victory, many hope a trump presidency won't be as bad as feared.

" trump has been under heavy scrutiny in recent months for using tax-exempt foundation money to pay for personal expenses, such as legal settlements with governments and paintings of himself. on page 5 of the donald j. trump foundation's 2015 tax filing, the preparers checked the ""yes"" box to the question about whether the new york-based non-profit organization had transferred ""any income or assets to a disqualified person (or make any of either available for the benefit or use of a disqualified person."" the preparers checked yes again in another box that asked if the foundation had transferred money to disqualified people in previous years. trump signed past filings under penalty of perjury, and the forms for several earlier years indicated the foundation had not transferred money to a disqualified person. the irs manual states that a transaction involving a disqualified person ""bears importantly upon the treatment and status of exempt organizations as private foundations in several situations."" it was unclear tuesday whether the nation's tax agency had received an identical document from trump's non-profit group. the irs said it could not discuss any tax filing or comment on whether the tax agency was investigating the person or organization associated with a filing. trump's presidential transition spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions from usa today. the apparent admission of self-dealing ""could be assessed as an irs penalty against the person who received the benefit, potentially at three times the value,"" said robert mckenzie, a tax law expert who is a partner at the arnstein & lehr law firm in chicago. the irs could seek penalties against the directors of the foundation -- who include trump and three of his children -- ""for allowing such a transaction,"" mckenzie said. attorneys for charitable organizations often are able to negotiate lower penalties than those proposed by the irs, mckenzie said. the foundation's new admission could result in separate penalties by state agencies that oversee the non-profit group, mckenzie said. new york attorney general eric schneiderman had been conducting an examination of filings submitted by trump's charitable organization. that investigation is continuing, amy spitalnick, schneiderman's spokeswoman, said tuesday. last month, schneiderman ordered the foundation to cease any fundraising in new york, saying the charity had not filed the required registration with his office. the new york official demanded, and received, written confirmation that the foundation would pay no part of the $25 million settlement reached last week over fraud allegations against trump university -- the defunct real estate training program created by the billionaire developer and reality television star. according to guidestar spokesperson jackie enterline fekeci, the new tax filing ""was uploaded by a representative from morgan, lewis & bockius llp directly onto the foundation's guidestar nonprofit profile on november 18. we allow organizations to submit their 990s voluntarily because sometimes the form's route through the irs causes a delay before we get the officially filed version. we do that in the good faith that the version they upload onto guidestar is identical to the version they submit to the irs."" the washington post has reported in great detail about problems with the trump foundation and its spending, citing how it paid $258,000 in foundation money to settle trump's personal legal issues. the post was the first to report on the new filings tuesday. the 2015 tax filing showed that trump's company donated $566,370 to the foundation last year, while it received another $50,000 from trump productions. it's possible these contributions came from trump, because they listed the donations as coming from a ""person."" these contributions are the first that trump or his companies have made to trump's own charity since 2008. his foundation's tax return for 2008 showed a $30,000 contribution from donald j",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"'Self-dealing' found in Trump tax filings; Foundation transferred assets to 'disqualified person,' document says",11/23/16
" going once, going twice, gone! do i hear dow 20,000? seth masters, chief investment officer at bernstein private wealth management who boldly predicted dow 20,000 by 2022  in 2012 when the dow jones industrial average traded around 13,000 in early june, says the dow can eclipse 20,000 earlier than he originally predicted. ""i don't know the precise date, but we will be ahead of schedule,"" masters told usa today in an interview monday, adding the iconic blue chip stock gauge could hurdle the 20,000 milestone as early as next year. ""2017? of course it could happen in 2017."" the dow traded above 19,000 for the first time tuesday and closed up 67 points to close at a record of 19,023.87. traveling from dow 19,000 to dow 20,000 is not that long of a journey, if measured in stock market miles, as each additional 1,000-point increment equates to an increasingly smaller percentage change. a 1,000-point move to 20,000, for example, equates to a gain of just 5.3%. in contrast, the dow had to double in value from its first close above 1,000 in november 1972 to its maiden voyage above 2,000 in january 1987, according to data compiled by s&p dow jones indices. similarly, the dow's jump from 10,000 to 11,000 in spring 1999 marked a more sizable 10% gain. the latest dow breakout has been dubbed the ""trump rally."" after donald trump's surprise win in the nov. 8 presidential election, wall street has been pricing in stronger economic growth and higher corporate profits in the future, due in large part to trump's more business-friendly and ""america first"" economic policies. investors are betting if the trump administration, with the help of a republican-controlled congress, follows through on its promises of lower taxes, fewer regulations on businesses, negotiating better trade deals and spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fix the nation's aging infrastructure, it will jump-start growth -- and provide fresh life for the  bull market, which is coming up on its eighth birthday in march. ""trump's election has unleashed 'animal spirits' that (british economist) john maynard keynes talked about,"" says nick sargen, senior investment strategist at fort washington investment advisors. ""investors are hoping his policies ... will boost growth and corporate profits."" that big, bullish bet has sparked a rush of investment dollars back into the u.s.  market. the new case for stocks has powered the dow to a 3.4% gain since election day and enabled it to take out the 19,000 milestone, nearly two years after it  crossed the 18,000 threshold dec. 23, 2014. still, sargen counters there are headwinds on the horizon. ""for the time being, investors are ignoring the spikes in bond yields (the 10-year treasury note is above 2.3% for the first time in a year) and the dollar (up 10 of the past 11 sessions), which should have a dampening effect on the rally at some point,"" says sargen, adding a market scare related to trump-inspired protectionism could also hurt the bullish vibe. in 2012, when  masters shocked the world with his provocative dow 20,000 call, investors -- still spooked by the financial devastation of the great recession and worst stock market decline since the great depression -- were in a defensive shell. they were shifting their money out of stocks into safer investments such as cash and bonds. in contrast, masters at the time was bullish on stocks due to the bearish investor sentiment and his view that earnings and the economy would grow at a decent clip. he also argued that stocks weren't expensive when record low bond yields were taken into account. ""investors were very, very pessimistic  then,"" masters recalls. ""the idea that the dow could get to 20,000 seemed far-fetched."" today, investor sentiment has brightened. and with corporate america continuing to buy back large helpings of its own stock, masters sees corporate earnings growth coming in at a pace of 4.5% to 5%. ""in that kind of environment, in the next few years you will see mid- to single-digit returns for stocks, so within a few years you get to dow 20,000."" so if the dow hits 20,000 soon,  before masters' 2022 prediction, will the dow be a buy or a sell? it depends on the reason the dow is breaking out, masters argues. ""if we get to dow 20,000 because sentiment gets hugely optimistic and price-to-earnings ratios (or the market's valuation level) rise a lot, i would be worried,"" masters says",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Stock market yo-yo's toward Dow 20,000; After soaring past 19,000, moonshot milestone may arrive sooner than forecast",11/23/16

" that's a summary of how brad pitt has tackled his media tour for throwback spy drama allied (in theaters wednesday), which lands smack-dab in the middle of his divorce negotiations with angelina jolie. paramount, which is distributing the world war ii tale, has carefully managed allied's pre-thanksgiving rollout. in los angeles, pitt smiled and took selfies with fans alongside co-star marion cotillard at a ""fan event"" but did not participate in the news conference. in shanghai, paris and london, pitt greeted fans but did not engage with the media. while the world awaits answers -- which may never come -- about why the a-list couple split in september, a glossy new film can only help the image crisis that pitt suffered after being accused of child abuse. (he was  cleared by child protective services in los angeles and is pursuing joint custody of his six children with jolie.) but will allied be the hit he needs? reviews are mixed on the spy film, which 60% of critics like on aggregate review site rotten tomatoes. in usa today's review, brian truitt noted the leads ""are missing a lot of needed heat"" and warned fans not to ""expect mr. and mrs. smith with nazis."" box office analysts don't think that allied -- a prestige project in a holiday week crowded with popcorn fare like moana and fantastic beasts and where to find them -- will accurately take the temperature of pitt's star power. predictions hover around $15million to $20 million for allied's first five days in theaters. ""it's a period piece, it's a war drama. it's not like 'the kids are all talking about it,'"" says comscore senior media analyst paul dergarabedian, who notes that brangelina's contentious split may have increased awareness of the film. in any case, it doesn't hurt to have pitt looking dashing onscreen, the sort of coiffed turn he typically avoids. allied ""looks like it could have been made in the '40s, much less be about the '40s,"" says deadline awards columnist pete hammond.

" after receiving high praise during its late-summer debut, the twice-recalled and ultimately discontinued phablet phone had a tendency to catch on fire. fortunately, the products on this list might be deemed hot for another reason. google pixel. pixels are the first phones in which google took over all aspects of the hardware and software design, borrowing from apple's playbook, resulting in a superb, well-rounded smartphone. the cameras are excellent, certainly on par with the equally fine iphone 7 plus and samsung galaxy s7 shooters. what particularly stands out is the presence of the google assistant, the voice-driven, artificial-intelligence-infused digital assistant. while not perfect, assistant encourages you to have a conversation, helped out at times by contextual buttons  on the screen with suggested replies. the phone runs the latest version of android called nougat and also supports google's new mobile daydream virtual-reality headset. a 5-inch version starts at $649; the 5.5-inch pixel xl model starts at $769. sony playstation vr. this has been a breakout year of sorts for virtual reality headgear, and choosing a winner has a lot to do with your budget and perspective. google brought out the aforementioned $79 daydream, which competes most directly with samsung's $99.99 gear vr, both decent solutions for folks with compatible mobile phones. at the high-end of the vr spectrum, we saw the debuts of the ($599, or $798 with soon-to-be available touch controllers) oculus rift and ($799) htc vive, the latter of which exploits what is known as room-scale vr. enter sony playstation vr. at $399.99, it isn't exactly cheap either, and that price doesn't include the required ($59.99) camera, or the pair of motion controllers ($99.99) that you're probably going to want. and oh yeah, you need a playstation 4 console as well, which starts at $299.99 before any black friday discounts. but many already have the console, and either way the experience is a lot cheaper than with rift or vive. eero. until i installed the $399 eero wi-fi system in my house, poky internet was too-often the norm. eero solved that. it consists of what are essentially three identical internet routers, each a small white box with no antennas sticking out. they exploit so-called ""mesh"" networking technology and work together to extend the wi-fi signal throughout your home. new addition: the ability to take advantage of certain ""skills"" through amazon's alexa voice, provided you have an amazon, echo, echo dot or tap. echo dot. speaking of which, the $49.99 echo dot is the smaller and considerably cheaper version of amazon's standalone echo speaker; it looks like amazon chopped an inch-and-a-half off the full-sized echo model. dot contains its own speaker, and while it is not as good as the speaker inside the regular echo, you can connect it wirelessly through bluetooth to your own better speakers. i've turned dot (which has no screen) into a bedside companion. it's a terrific way to get to know alexa, which can deliver news, answer questions, play music, set an alarm or order an uber, among its more than 4,000 voice-driven skills. ios 10. the features in ios 10 that have garnered the most attention since apple launched the latest version of its mobile operating system for iphones and ipads are the stickers and fanciful effects inside the messages apps, along with improvements to maps, apple music, photos, home screen widgets and siri. and yes, some of these features find apple playing catchup to rivals. google photoscan. if you're like me, you have boxes of old photo prints lying around that you'd like to restore or salvage in digital form. you can certainly ship them off to a paid service such as scanmyphotos.com or imemories.com, and if you have a ton of pics that might be the easiest, albeit costliest, way to handle the job. if you've got a flatbed scanner at your disposal, you can certainly employ that method as well. but the new photoscan app for ios and android, an offshoot of google's excellent photos app, is a simple and surprisingly decent way to tackle the task, if a bit slow as you go one by one. using the photoscan app and camera on your smartphone, you snap four pictures of the analog picture you're trying to capture, by lining up each of the four small circles that appear on top of the image inside the app. and that's it. google's software works its magic to mostly eliminate the glare that would have appeared had you taken a picture of the picture without the app. if satisfied with the result you can store the image inside google photos and at your discretion share it. photoscan even works with framed photos or pictures hanging on the wall. pokí©mon go. i have to admit i got caught up in the viral frenzy that is pokí©mon go, niantic lab's hit location-based mobile augmented reality app. research firm sensor tower said pokí©mon go was the fastest mobile app to reach 10 million downloads and exceeded $200million in worldwide net revenue during its first month of availability in july. facebook live. ok so technically, facebook live launched in 2015, as facebook's live-streaming alternative to meerkat and twitter's periscope. but facebook live was originally limited to designated vips, and it was only this past april  that ceo mark zuckerberg opened it up to everyone on the gigantic social network and went live himself. snapchat spectacles. i thought long and hard before including spectacles mainly because the chances of any of you landing a pair anytime soon are slim. the glasses are only sold through yellow pop-up vending machines called snapbots, which turn up around the country with minimal advanced notice to potential buyers. but the social media buzz around snap's $129",MONEY;

""" that's what minister nancy taylor and her congregation at old south church in boston are doing to prepare for the holiday. by this method, all those in the conversation listen silently to whoever holds the real or metaphorical stick and, thus, the floor. no interrupting, arguing, rolling your eyes, or sighing in exasperation. eventually it's your turn, and you receive the same consideration, while remembering that the stick, like the opportunity to speak, is not to be used to bash anyone. actual stick or not, this is a good way to approach the holiday, and to make the most of an aspect of thanksgiving gatherings for which we should be truly grateful this year: the rare opportunity to interact with people different from us and our usual company. political opposites a study by the public religion research institute finds that nearly half of white working-class americans, for instance, report having no one in their immediate social network who supported hillary clinton for president. in my own blue state network -- blue in terms of depression, now, as well as voting tendencies -- i encounter few donald trump supporters. this is a shame because, as the dalai lama and arthur c. brooks recently pointed out in a commentary, ""the problems we face (in society) cut across conventional categories; so must our dialogue, and our friendships."" our encounters with our political opposites, on the rare occasions when they do take place, are often those of the facebook variety, frequently involving upper-case letters and ending in unfriendings. (it's not the case that something you say on social media is automatically true if written in capital letters.) when taylor asked her boston congregation whether their families were divided over this election, three-quarters of them raised their hands. this points to the likelihood that many of us are headed toward thanksgiving gatherings where we'll be sharing the table with family members who voted for the other candidate. isn't it best to ignore politics for the sake of politesse and argument avoidance? shouldn't we keep the chatter confined to football and what the kids are doing? maybe, if our feelings of anger or cocky triumphalism are still running hot. if you're a clinton supporter and your trump-loving parent starts in about the evils of political correctness -- and you are not up for that conversation -- play the thanksgiving card, advises psychologist and author deborah sandella. point out that thanksgiving is a day for gratitude, not political arguments. and if you're the one tempted to do the goading, give it a rest. shared opportunity if we're in the right frame of mind and able to muster some curiosity, thanksgiving presents a grand opportunity. true, we are not going to change our father-in-law's mind with our clever retorts over pumpkin pie. but we can listen and learn about how things look from the other side. and we can have the valuable experience of having our own views heard and considered. trump enthusiasts, you might contemplate the fact that some of the people with whom you are gathering at thanksgiving are devastated by the election result and thinking trump and his supporters are all bad, only bad. prove your clinton-loving relative wrong. treat him or her with graciousness. clinton supporters might do something that's even harder. we might admit that despite our supposed sophistication, we missed the juggernaut that trump activated and rode to his electoral college victory. we might concede that despite our confidence in a clinton victory and our supposed superior understanding of the world, we, like so many pollsters and analysts, were wrong. family ties and the love they represent are too valuable to squander over an election, says christian piatt, author of the new book leaving a-holiness behind, in which piatt urges fellow christians toward more gracious interactions with those of different beliefs. piatt, a progressive, is challenging himself to hold that thought high in his mind as he heads into thanksgiving with conservative relatives. that's a lead we ought to follow on thursday, whichever way we voted nov. 8. in real life, after all, we can't unfriend our family",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Don't be a Turkey; This post-election Thanksgiving, listen, don't interrupt, and be heard",11/23/16
" the potential for a rollback in regulation and a corporate tax rate of 15% are reasons the stock market has reacted so positively to trump's plans. but what about entrepreneurs and emerging businesses? will this area still be the growth story it has been? and where will the jobs and growth come from in coming years? i caught up with serial entrepreneur jessica herrin, ceo and founder of stella & dot (and before that weddingchannel.com in the 1990s). herrin has created what she calls a modern-day mary kay, where she relies on specialists or stylists to get her accessories to customers. our interview follows, edited for clarity and length. q: stella & dot is the second company you've created. how tough was it? a: i first started my career in technology and quickly realized  you could create professional success without really creating impact and happiness. and i became motivated to start another business that would really make a difference on something i was passionate about, and that was creating more flexible work for women. i began in my living room while i had another full-time job, and i was pregnant and wanted to reinvent what the on-the-go business opportunity could be for the modern woman that would be about great product, use of technology and really putting profits in your pocket by reinventing the model. q: tell us about stella & dot and how it works. a: stella & dot is a family of brands that has grown into two accessories brands, stella & dot and keep collective. and we're also a platform that launched a skincare brand.  with stella & dot, we've taken a couture design process and applied that to affordable luxury. so half of our product line is under $50, and it really is style made simple. our stylists are really a personal shopper that help girlfriends who get together and try it on at home, or shop online ... for that busy woman who wants to look pulled together but needs a little help. keep is a more memory-based line which makes the ultimate personalized gift and is  a keepsake. our skincare brand is creating a good-for-you product that gives results. q: you started the wedding channel back in the '90s. a: wedding channel had a very non-sexy start. i was working at a tech company that was bringing together price and availability information to help make assembling computers easier. i applied that basic thought to bring together the information of where people were registered for wedding gifts and make it easy for people to shop for that online. this was during the birth of e-commerce. so instead of having consumers go into a store, they could easily check out in minutes by searching a couple's name, finding the different stores they were registered in and purchase a wedding gift. so it was really about taking technology and creating a very simple solution to a large-market customer problem. q: a lot of people have great ideas, but they don't know how to execute them. a: i just wrote a book, find your extraordinary, that chronicles my entrepreneurial journey. and it really talks about the entrepreneurial spirit. because for most people, having an idea, or even access to capital, isn't enough. it's about the motivation and will to be tenacious enough to actually get an idea off the ground and turn it into a viable business. every overnight success story takes seven to 10 years. it's harder than you think. for me, i had to drop out of business school and raise venture capital, and that's how i started wedding channel. i was very convinced that i wanted to do stella & dot differently so that i could keep control of the mission and run the business for impact instead of profits. that meant that i had to bootstrap. i had another full-time job, and i didn't take a (stella & dot) paycheck for six years. you have to stick with it. it's about finding the right people that can partner with you, who are experts in the area that you need to know about. and then it's about being productive and getting the right things done. q: what about the money end of it? a: i went back to the people that had been on my board at wedding channel. that was productive because we had a working relationship, so they invested seed capital into this business. it's definitely a silicon valley anomaly that we spent $2 million to get to profitability. and that's compared to the hundreds of millions other companies of our size have raised, and they're not necessarily even at profitability yet. i wanted to fund the business off of sales growth and not be in the business of turning a dollar into a dime but really doing something  sustainable. and that took bootstrapping. it took a lot of sacrifice. but it was worth it because now our business isn't about who needs a liquidity event and who's trying to post profits for the quarter for wall street. it's truly about serving our business owners and making an impact on the workplace for women. q: what was the initial investment you received from outside investors? a: i had invested myself and was funding the business until i brought in partners. i think our seed round of capital was about $250,000. and that was maybe a year or so into the business when we already were generating about that much in revenue. as we went to grow and hire people, then we needed to raise another couple of million dollars. q: was it hard for you to accept that you aren't going to be the only sheriff in town? a: bringing in people and partners is essential for success. and i needed other people to care and have skin in the game. so i didn't think about it as giving up ownership. i thought about it as gaining another person who cared as much as i did about driving the business to succeed in order to serve the mission. and if you pick the right partners, you're gonna feel that way too. so to escalate my own commitment, i paced getting that investment around the birth of my two daughters and knowing that i was ready to commit to other people around the trajectory of the business. i've always looked at my partners as welcome seats at the table who care as much as i do and are equally responsible for creating the success. blythe harris, who's the chief creative officer, joined a couple years into the business and became a partner. she also invested in the business. and that was essential for our success. q:  tell us where the business is going. a: each of our three brands is only at the beginning stages of its market potential. we're very focused on broadening our impact on how many people we help earn flexible income, often on top of another full-time job.  so our focus is using our three brands in the six countries that we're in to capture all the untapped demand that's out there for the $30 billion accessory market in north america and the multibillion-dollar skincare market, where we feel we really have disruptive products people love. q: and the way you do it is different, sort of like a mary kay or an avon lady, right?

lower taxes and lower regulations? a: well, we're also potentially expecting tariffs to go up. so we're in a ""let's see what actually comes to fruition and gets put into law versus what might have been part of a campaign rhetoric"" mode. i believe in what we do and why we do it. i believe people need flexible income. so from our perspective, i'm optimistic about continued growth because we make great products and we do it for a great reason. from a general economy perspective, i believe when you lower corporate taxes you give businesses the ability to invest. so if businesses are operating responsibly and they're focused on job creation in the u.s., that will be good for the economy",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Herrin proudly promotes A workplace for women; Entrepreneur uses specialists to deliver accessories to clients,11/23/16

" for warren beatty, it's time to go back to work. after 15 years away from filmmaking to spend more time with his actress-wife, annette bening, and their four children, the 79-year-old hollywood legend writes, directs, produces and stars as eccentric billionaire howard hughes in the comedy/drama rules don't apply (in theaters wednesday). ""i've really taken time to luxuriate in the whole family life, which is something i didn't do earlier,"" he says. like the movie's aspiring actress, marla mabrey (lily collins), beatty had a baptist upbringing in virginia. and like marla's driver, frank forbes (alden ehrenreich), he also had a mind for business. ""when you draw on things from your own life, you try to spread it around, so it doesn't seem like it's autobiographical,"" says beatty, whose directorial efforts also include heaven can wait (1978), reds (1981), dick tracy (1990) and bulworth (1998). the oscar-winning icon talks about rules, taking on real-life characters and getting to the truth. q what's your secret for doing these all-in movies and not going stir-crazy? a (pauses) did i say i haven't gone crazy? q you seem sane enough. a i'm misleading you. (laughs) q had you been kicking around the idea of an old-school hollywood movie? a the first picture i made (elia kazan's 1961 drama splendor in the grass) was a hit, and i had a lot more freedom than other people my age. i've never made a lot of movies -- i've made fewer movies than anybody who's been around as long as i have. and i've been around a long time. (laughs) i'll have an idea in the back of my mind, and it takes me a while to actually get around to doing it. q what rules apply to playing a real-life person like hughes? a when you take a person who's actually lived -- and i've done it three times before, with bonnie and clyde, bugsy and reds -- you find yourself fictionalizing constantly and, to some extent, a large component of history is fiction. q is that why you begin the movie with a quote from hughes? a (in my approach to the movie) i quoted three people: i quoted henry ford, who said, ""history is bunk""; i quoted winston churchill, who said, ""history will be very kind to me because i intend to write it""; and i quoted napoleon, who said, ""history is a set of lies agreed upon."" i threw them all out and i stuck with one quote from howard hughes: ""never check an interesting fact."" q which of the quotes do you agree with the most? a they're all a little extreme because they're our great historians. but there's no way of knowing what actually happened. i've been through 15 books written about me and i've read no more than 15 pages of any of those books. then i put them aside because they're so full of baloney. they're invented to sell, and if you've been a hollywood actor, they try to make it as sexy as possible. q ever thought about writing your own and telling the truth? a sure",LIFE; Pg. 2D,USA TODAY,"Warren Beatty is still playing by his own 'Rules'; After a 15-year break, he's back in film with a vengeance",11/23/16

""there's a mystique surrounding him that's never gone away because he operated in such secretive and bizarre fashion."" part of his aura can be attributed to the fact that he was making movies such as hell's angels and the original 1930s scarface when filmgoers ""didn't know everything about celebrities as we do now with tabloids and social media,"" says fandango.com correspondent alicia malone. since his death in 1976 at  70, hughes has  popped up as a character in films, most notably as played by leonardo dicaprio in the 2004 biopic the aviator, which won five oscars. jason robards played the enigmatic man in 1980's melvin and howard, which centered on hughes' will, and terry o'quinn channeled the mogul in the 1991 action-adventure the rocketeer. everybody has a take because no one had a strong handle on his character, maltin figures. ""even the people around him had different views -- there's no unanimity about him. he could be kind, he could be generous, but more often he was mercurial and arbitrary to a point of almost literal madness."" in showing hughes'  quirks -- shying away from in-person meetings, being weirded out by small children, getting ocd about his ice-cream flavors -- beatty drew on stories from people who actually knew him. ""he's been a source of amusement for a long time for me,"" beatty says. in beatty's nearly 60 years in hollywood, he has met  people who knew hughes, ""and they all quite liked him but found him impossible to deal with because he could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted."" beatty was never introduced to hughes but says he had  ""comical near-brushes"" with him. by 1964, beatty was famous enough in hollywood to garner the attention of tabloids, and while staying at the beverly hills hotel, he sensed he was being spied on by two men in the suite next door. when beatty called to complain, the hotel operator said they were with hughes.

" well, if you assume  this netflix revival is the last we see of gilmore girls: a year in the life (nov. 25,  ***1/2 out of four), which these days in general -- and with this show in particular -- is probably  unwise. when  wb's cult hit  ended in 2007, after one last, unsatisfying  season on cw produced without creator amy sherman-palladino and writer daniel palladino, most fans feared they'd seen the last of lauren graham and alexis bledel as lorelai and rory gilmore. compounding the agony was a predominant -- though hardly universal -- feeling that the ending was unsatisfactory, a belief that has hardened with time into immutable truth. now the show is back with four 90-minute episodes, each named for one of the seasons, and all of them written by the palladinos. you get the same stars (for the most part) and the same rapid-fire, pop-culture-infused dialogue,  in a more concise package that actually serves the show well. the pace and the arch theatricality of all that chatter could grow exhausting over 22 hours. brevity, however, is not the only advantage girls has this time around. it benefits from having been gone long enough for many of us to miss it. and it returns, in all its dreamy, slightly loopy, generally optimistic lightness, at a time when many of us could use an escape. once again, you're following the gilmores and their extended family -- led by lorelai's on-again/off-again lover luke (scott patterson) and her mother, emily (the always fabulous kelly bishop) -- as they talk their way around the tourist trap that is stars hollow. time has passed and relationships have changed, but there's nothing or no one fans won't recognize and newcomers won't be able to figure out. not everyone was able to return, of course: the late edward herrmann is much missed, though his character, richard,  remains a heartwarming presence. a few other actors are either under- or overused: you get much less of melissa mccarthy's sookie than most would like and much more of sean gunn's kirk than some will like. as always, gilmore is not without its frustrations, which means that those who always found the constant babble and the flights of fancy unbearably twee will continue to do so. there are plots that just  peter out, abruptly change course or get lost in some eye-roll-inducing diversion. even the combined gifts of christian borle and sutton foster can't  quite excuse a  musical sequence that defies belief and  owes far too much to christopher guest's parody waiting for guffman and borle's own something rotten. yet for every misstep, there's a moment from graham or bledel that makes you laugh or breaks your heart, or that cuts through the cuteness to ring  true. and even at its most exasperating (as with those infamous ""final four words""), there is so much talent and charm on display, you're likely to be in a forgiving mood. so welcome back, girls",LIFE; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,"You'll laugh and cry, again, at 'Gilmore Girls'",11/25/16

" but in russia, the president-elect is being embraced with widespread approval. in fact, many here think he'll be one of the best american presidents ever. just less than half of those surveyed after the u.s. election by vtsiom, a state-run research center, said that if given the opportunity, they would have voted for the billionaire new york businessman. only 4% said they would have backed democrat hillary clinton, who took a hard line against russia during her tenure as secretary of state. the survey found that about a third of russians think trump will likely go on to become one of the best presidents in u.s. history. ""trump is a huge advantage for russia,"" said muscovite gleb samorukov. ""it's clear trump's willing to figure out some of the problems we have between our two countries."" samorukov said he believes russia is doing its best to resolve differences with the u.s. over russia's annexation of crimea and its backing of separatists in eastern ukraine, as well as disagreements about how to deal with the civil war in syria and president bashar assad. president obama has had tense relations with russian president vladimir putin since russia's intervention in neighboring ukraine in 2014, a move that prompted western sanctions against russia. the two men also have clashed over syria's war: russia's military is supporting assad against rebel groups, while obama is supporting some of those rebels and wants the syrian leader to step down because of brutal attacks on civilians. in another flash point, u.s. intelligence agencies allege that the russian government tried to interfere in the u.s. election by hacking into the email accounts of the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee, a charge putin denies. by contrast, candidate trump praised putin's strong leadership style and promised after his election to improve relations with a country that had been the united state's longtime cold war rival. ""it's definitely changed the atmosphere for the good,"" said ian artemey, an economics student from st. petersburg. ""i like him."" russians also like putin -- a lot, if state-run media and polls can be believed. his approval ratings have soared amid the increase in tensions with the united states, reaching an all-time high of nearly 90% in october, vtsiom found. mark galeotti, an expert on russia at the institute of international relations in prague, said putin appears more comfortable with a trump presidency, at least for now.

""there are some prospects economic sanctions might be lifted or moderated, and on this issue, where washington leads, the europeans will certainly follow."" long term, though, trump is not necessarily what russia's government would have wanted and could worry the kremlin, galeotti said.

white may not be our best guide. his ode to democracy 73 years ago made no mention of the thousands of japanese-americans the government had just thrown into concentration camps, or millions of african-americans denied the right to vote. better to heed barack obama on election night four years ago: ""democracy, in a nation of 300 million, can be noisy and messy and complicated."" he couldn't have known just how noisy, messy or complicated; democracy at thanksgiving 2016 requires less an ode than a prayer. democracy today is the cast of a hit broadway musical confronting the vice president-elect in the audience. it is the vice president-elect turning to his daughter and saying, ""that's the sound of democracy."" and it is an audience member complaining to a reporter after the show that she didn't come to hamilton to hear about politics. democracy is fourth-generation new englanders gathering for the annual town meeting to vote on whether to buy a new fire engine. it is first-generation alt-righters gathered in washington to shout ""heil!"" and listen to their leader quote nazi propaganda in the original german. and it's what the current german chancellor says must be a basis for her country's working relationship with the president-elect. democracy is a public handshake between the president-elect, who'd called mitt romney a ""choke artist,"" and romney, who once called the president-elect a ""con man."" it is some anonymous creep on the internet calling hillary clinton the c-word. democracy is voters waiting patiently on election day in lines that  spilled out the door, through the schoolyard, around the corner and down the block. it is also the eventual winner complaining for months beforehand than the system was rigged. democracy is democrats in the street, chanting ""not my president!"" and democrats in church, praying together aloud for ""donald, our president-elect."" democracy is the ventura county, calif., registrar of voters not getting a single request for police assistance on election day from any of his 365 precincts. and it is the sea of 20,000 pink ""provisional"" ballots, many cast by people apparently unregistered in the place where they voted. democracy is an ""i voted"" sticker on your chest. it is colin kaepernick, the nfl quarterback famous for taking a knee during the national anthem, saying he's never voted because ""i'm not going to show support for that system. ... the oppressor isn't going to allow you to vote your way out of your oppression."" democracy after election day is some students waving the confederate flag at lemoyne college in upstate new york, and the administration first lowering and then removing the u.s. flag after protests at hampshire college in western massachusetts. democracy is the mere 100,000 voters in three states who, by the reckoning of eric sasson in the new republic, made the difference between a second president clinton and a first president trump. democracy is black lives matter, and the blue stripe painted inside the double yellow lines down main street. democracy is a magnet, witness little saigon in houston, texas, little odessa in brighton beach, n.y.,  and little managua in sweetwater, fla. there is democracy and there is in russia what vladimir putin's supporters call ""managed democracy."" the distinction was explained to the financial times by an anonymous political consultant: ""democracy is where the authorities arrange elections. managed democracy is where the authorities arrange the elections and the result."" e.b. white's feelings about democracy resonate still. some of his images and metaphors do not. democracy, he wrote, is ""the feeling of privacy in the voting booths, the feeling of communion in the libraries ..."" yet today, in at least 20 states, it is legal to take a selfie inside the voting booth and post it online, as many voters proudly do. as for the libraries, americans say they love them, but the percentage who visited one in previous 12 months dropped from 53% in 2014 to 44% last year, according to a pew study. white also called democracy ""the mustard on the hot dog."" it's a dated metaphor that, as seth lerer of ucal-san diego -- a scholar of white's children's literature (charlotte's web, stuart little) -- says would get him laughed out of his classroom if he used it with his students. at least one of white's symbolic trappings of democracy -- ""a letter to the editor'' -- is still in ready supply. some recent examples are on point: ""our democratic principles and values are at risk like never before. canada is looking ever more appealing ..."" -- elizabeth wallen, springfield, ky.

""they've been successful in defeating (the islamic state) anywhere they've encountered them,"" he said. the islamic state ""considers raqqa their capital in syria, so we expect resistance to stiffen as forces move closer to the city,"" dorrian said. the raqqa offensive, which started earlier this month, will be the sdf's largest test. president-elect donald trump has expressed skepticism about a separate covert u.s. program to support opposition groups fighting to overthrow syrian president bashar assad, who has so far survived after more than five years of civil war. trump has not commented on the pentagon program that supports the sdf's fight against the islamic state. the sdf is about 30,000 strong and consists mainly of kurds. turkey's government opposes the force because of a push by kurds in turkey, syria and iraq to carve out an independent state, which could be enhanced by victories over the islamic militants. partly to allay turkey's concern, the united states has given $30million in weapons and other equipment only to the non-kurdish faction of the sdf. the pentagon is trying to increase arabs in the force because raqqa is an arab city, and a mostly kurdish invasion would likely alienate residents. the u.s. military had urged the group to advance on raqqa at the same time iraqi forces are attacking mosul, iraq's second-largest city, to regain control from the islamic state. the thinking is that simultaneous operations will pose a tougher challenge for the militants. the pentagon has several hundred advisers in syria working with the sdf and has supported the ground campaign with airstrikes. the sdf is stitched together from hundreds of tribal groups and lacks an organized command structure. the pentagon said only a fraction of the 30,000 fighters are involved in the raqqa campaign. the syrian defense forces are attempting to isolate raqqa by cutting off supply routes into the city before entering it. ""we do expect this isolation phase to go on for a number of weeks, perhaps months even,"" dorrian said. the kurds have proven to be fierce and tenacious fighters. months after iraq's military collapsed in the face of the islamic state's 2014 invasion, a small group of kurds managed to hold off a massive assault by the militants on the syrian city kobani, which is on the turkish border. they dealt one of the first blows to the islamic state, proving their fighting skills. more recently, a force of kurds and arabs drove the islamic state from the town of manbij, another major defeat for the islamic state. the sdf has retaken about 100 square miles of terrain since the raqqa operation began, the u.s.-led coalition said. u.s. military officials said the manbij operation was a model for arab-kurdish cooperation in defeating the islamic state: arab forces participated in the offensive and are responsible for holding the mostly arab city. u.s. officials said they will pursue a similar strategy in raqqa. ""we're going to try to recruit and train a force that's from the local area,"" said lt. gen. stephen townsend, commander of the task force for iraq and syria. the pentagon said u.s.-led coalition aircraft have dropped 250 munitions, including bombs and rockets, since the raqqa operation began. that kind of support is critical to the success of the operation, said andrew tabler, an analyst at the washington institute for near east policy",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,U.S.-backed forces put to huge test; Offensive for ISIL's Syrian stronghold in Raqqa now underway,11/25/16
" jeff sessions in 2006 agreed the voting rights act should live on for another 25 years, but that lone vote does not reflect the attorney general nominee's previous efforts to dismantle a key tool for enforcing the law in the south. president-elect donald trump last week said he wants the alabama senator to run the justice department, putting sessions' record on race in the spotlight. thirty-year-old allegations he used racially offensive language have been a focal point, so sessions' allies are fighting back with character references and endorsements from african americans. part of their defense has been to note that sessions voted to renew the voting rights act 10 years ago when it was last up for reauthorization in congress. the landmark law since 1965 has protected the rights of minorities to have their voices heard in an electoral process that once banned them. president george w. bush signed the law's renewal in 2006 after congress approved it with overwhelming bipartisan support, including sessions, who acknowledged his state's shameful history of poll taxes and literacy tests, and applauded the law's role in its progress. ""the people of alabama understand that these changes in our state are good, and they do not want to do anything that would suggest that there is any interest in moving away from the great right to vote. we want to reauthorize the voting rights act,"" sessions said then. but for many years beforehand, sessions was part of a campaign of southern republicans who believed the law had become an unfair, outdated burden that didn't reflect the increased black voter registration and number of black elected officials. under section 5 of the voting rights act, places with a history of persistent discrimination -- like alabama -- couldn't run their elections without special oversight and approval of a watchful federal government. sessions argued as early as 1996, before he ran for the u.s. senate, that the voting rights act was being used to engineer certain political outcomes, not just protect access to the ballot box. as alabama attorney general, sessions opposed two legal actions -- taken in the name of the voting rights act -- that civil rights advocates believed would have improved the chances for blacks to be elected as judges in alabama. sessions defeated both. in 1997, his first year in the senate, sessions' protí©gí© and successor testified to congress that section 5 should be repealed or amended. then-alabama attorney general bill pryor called it ""an affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness."" in 2006 when congress started holding hearings about reauthorizing the voting rights act, sessions was among those who questioned the need for section 5, which required state and local election officials in nine states to submit every election-related change to a federal judge or the department of justice to determine whether it was unfair to minority voters. sessions said he wanted congress to ""see if there are other areas of the country that might ought to be covered by some of these provisions, see if there are some areas that are covered now that no longer need to be."" in the end, congress decided to renew the 1965 law without changing or repealing section 5. sessions went along, but with reservations. ""i am worried because... (the extension) does little to acknowledge the tremendous progress made over the past 40 years in alabama and other covered jurisdictions,"" sessions said then. the senate voted 98-0 to renew the voting rights act.

" trump's victory wasn't just about gaining the underemployed, angry, rural white vote. in naples, one of the wealthiest communities in the country with a median household income of roughly $80,500, former corporate executives overwhelmingly supported trump and his calls for cutting government regulations and rebuilding the country's infrastructure. francis rooney, the naples multimillionaire ceo of manhattan construction and prolific gop donor who was just elected to congress, said he voted for trump and supported his calls to get rid of the dodd-frank act, which went into law after the great recession. the law has been criticized for the regulatory burden it has put on banks and other business. john sorey, the ex-ceo of the spectrum corp. in tennessee, said he voted for trump in the hope that investments in the country's infrastructure will have a ""multiple effect"" on job creation. phyllis ""flip"" west, a naples retiree whose family owned a west virginia welding company, said she voted for trump because the country ""needs to be run as a business."" ""the whole big thing is the economy,"" west, 78, said. ""we need to bring it back."" west is one of an outsized population of ex-ceos and business supervisors in naples, a retirement town with a population of roughly 20,000 that prides itself on its annual multimillion dollar wine festival fundraisers and high-end sports car shows. the area's rich donors and corporate executives, many of whom keep their private jets at the city's municipal airport, turned out largely for former ceo mitt romney in the 2012 election. but setting aside concerns that traditionally conservative areas might abandon this year's gop nominee, trump's background as a real estate developer and company owner helped convince naples business leaders that he can grow the economy. ""he gets things done,"" said sorey, 73, who is also the former mayor of naples. ""the most similarity among naples voters is the fact that they like success and see success as a positive attribute."" trump is also proposing a major tax cut for wealthy residents like the ones in naples, including a cut of 6.5% to the country's top 1% of earners, according to an analysis by the tax policy center. naples business leaders, including some who have donated millions to republican presidential candidates in the past, were split during the gop florida primary, with some leaders supporting former florida  governor jeb bush or florida sen. marco rubio. rooney, who relocated his oklahoma company's headquarters to naples in 2002, has close ties to the bush family. his company built the texas rangers baseball stadium in arlington when george w. bush was part owner of the team. rooney was a top fundraiser for bush and later served as his ambassador to the vatican. rooney said he voted for jeb bush in the primary. but once the republican party chose trump as its nominee, rooney said, he was ""all in."" he said he supports trump's call to repeal or modify the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. john allen, a real estate executive and major naples donor whose waterfront home is valued at more than $12million, said he voted for rubio in the primary but ultimately supported trump because of his business experience. ""on the heels of a president that was totally unqualified to be president -- who never built a job or ran a company, had a payroll or created benefits -- did i like the fact that trump had tremendous success, that he has a background and did it in new york city and other difficult environments? yes, i found that attractive,"" allen, 62, said. ""he understands investment and return and is willing to take risks,"" allen said. ""he's an outspoken advocate of the free enterprise system."" the area's less enthusiastic trump supporters ultimately voted for him largely because of the flaws of democratic candidate hillary clinton, said kathleen passidomo, a naples lawyer and newly elected state senator. ""so many people i talked to -- not just republicans, but democrats and independents -- were really distressed about hillary clinton,"" said passidomo, who voiced concerns about trump after a video surfaced of him talking disparagingly about women. ""it wasn't just the emails. it was the elitism of the clinton dynasty and her expectation that she deserved the presidency because she was a clinton."" west, whose family owned a welding company, is a registered republican, but said she flipped parties in west virginia to vote for a democratic governor who supported the steel and coal industry that bought supplies from welders. she said she supported trump since the beginning of the gop primary because she believes he can ""bring trade back to our country."" she calls trade the ""tailcoat of the economy."" supporters see the possibility of trump achieving on the national level the same kind of progress floridians view from republican gov. rick scott, said mike lyster, chairman of the collier county republican executive committee. scott's 2010 gubernatorial campaign, similar to trump's presidential run, promoted scott as a businessman who had never held elected office. trump has said he's not beholden to his campaign donors, which could give him the ""best chance of any of the elected officials in washington to make good on his promises"" to improve the economy, passidomo said",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,Trump's biz success is appealing; Wealthy town of ex-CEOs believes it has found an ally in the new president,11/25/16
" the idea was on a sheet of proposals for the department of homeland security that was photographed when a member of trump's immigration transition team met with him sunday. the list of proposals carried by kansas secretary of state kris kobach also addressed trump's campaign pledge to cut off the program that accepts syrian refugees and to enhance screening of people from countries with ties to terrorism. kobach, who has authored kansas laws that are models for other states to crack down on illegal immigration, did not respond to requests for comments about the proposals. the so-called 287(g) program on the list allows the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agency to train local police officers and sheriffs deputies to locate and catch undocumented immigrants living in their communities. the program was created by congress in 1996 and used by president george w. bush. by 2010, local officers in 24 states were trained and empowered by ice to respond to crime scenes, make traffic stops and check local jails to determine the immigration status of suspects. the program was largely phased out by president obama. local officers now only work in local jails, not on the street. kobach's proposal suggests the program be ratcheted back up to ""at least 70 cities and counties"" when trump enters the white house in january. trump said in a post-election interview that a top priority will be deporting an estimated 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. expanding local enforcement would be a quick, cheap ""force multiplier"" for a trump administration intent on increasing deportations, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies, a group that favors steps to curb illegal immigration. she said federal agents are already stretched thin, and adding local officers to do immigration work would help expand their reach. ""i would expect ice to be inundated with applications"" from local agencies interested in taking part, vaughan said. ""it's a great thing for public safety and our immigration enforcement. you're going to have fewer criminal aliens falling through the cracks and more sent home rather than being allowed to stay in those communities."" opponents counter that expanding local enforcement would alienate communities with significant hispanic populations. lake county (ill.) sheriff mark curran, a former prosecutor, said he looked into the program when it was created, but changed his mind once he thought through the downside of such a step. curran said solving crimes requires witnesses to step forward and talk to police, something the hispanic community would not do if the officers were also acting as immigration agents. ""as soon as your police car pulls up, all the doors are going to shut,"" curran said. ""all they know is you dragged some relative of theirs out of the house a week ago who hadn't done anything but try to provide for his family. they're not going to want to cooperate with you."" curran, a republican who voted for trump, supports many aspects of the president-elect's plan to crack down on illegal immigration and said his office regularly cooperates with federal immigration investigations. but he was disappointed to hear that trump is considering the 287(g) program. ""my position is the same as most sheriffs in the country,"" curran said.

", is coming off a record tourism year as travelers celebrated the centennial of the national park service. yellowstone, the nation's first official park, in particular drew huge crowds. but just down the road another  milestone took place as jackson hole mountain resort,  arguably the world's top independent, family-owned ski resort, turned 50. the semicentennial comes on the heels of years of aggressive reinvestment and improvement at the resort and in town, including significant on-mountain improvements for the 2016-17 ski season. as jackson hole, long nicknamed the big one, enters its second half-century,  the resort and its namesake town are better positioned than ever  to welcome winter (and summer) tourists. the big one refers to both the immensity of terrain and the highest vertical drop of any ski resort in the usa, more than 4,100 feet. the breadth, height, rugged exposed vertical cliff bands and many extreme movies filmed here have always given jackson a rarefied air as a daunting ""expert"" mountain. but there is plenty of skiing for every ability, and it is a surprisingly good place for first-timers to learn. that's largely attributable to the  owners, the kemmerer family, which bought the resort  in 1992 and quickly kicked off decades of investment. in the more than 20 years since, the family has spent more than $150 million, added six chairlifts and two gondolas, and  replaced the red sled, the iconic aerial tram that soars from base to peak. last winter saw a new chairlift and on-mountain restaurant, piste mountain bistro. for this coming season, the big addition is the  $10 million sweetwater gondola, which marks the first phase of a dramatic expansion of the ski school. sweetwater will significantly increase capacity out of the base area, and it will later access a new dedicated teaching area and facility. welcome to teton village teton village is the ski resort's base area, where those seeking ski-in/ski-out lodging and easy access to the slopes choose to stay. while it has far less to offer in terms of lodging, dining and shopping than the actual town of jackson, choices have grown significantly in recent years, and it has evolved into more of a true village. ""food is also a real attraction,""  says kathryn noyes, an avid skier and physician who first came to jackson  after college to teach skiing in 2001, then returned after her residency to join a practice in town. ""some of my favorite restaurants are now in teton village: teton thai, osteria and the spur. you can also grab a drink for happy hour at the top of the gondola."" teton village is home to the most luxurious area hotels, including the four seasons jackson, one of only three forbes 5-star ski-in/out hotels in the nation. the resort also offers an assortment of ski-in/ski-out rental homes and condos in a variety of sizes and prices. jackson itself, or ""town"" as it is known, is 12 miles from the ski resort and teton village, and the biggest choice faced by winter visitors is where to stay. the village gives easy access to lifts and trails, but town has more of everything tourists seek out, especially charm. it's not a hard commute, due to a user-friendly bus system, and many hotels  operate their own  shuttles. jackson has old west flair and history, and it's full of art galleries, unique shops, tour operators and  hotels and restaurants. some of the more famous must-visits include the million dollar cowboy bar, where barstools are topped with saddles, and the silver dollar bar, where the drinking surface is inlaid with more than 1,000  uncirculated 1921 morgan silver dollars. ""i moved to jackson in 1996 and have seen the area grow tremendously since i first arrived,""  says gavin fine, a chef who  owns several popular area restaurants in town and teton village, including a popular tapas and wine bar, bin 22. ""besides the significant upgrades jackson hole mountain resort has invested in, which have improved on-mountain dining options and increased intermediate terrain, the entire valley's offerings have grown. ""while we've grown, a great deal of time and attention has been spent maintaining jackson's authenticity, which i believe is clear to anyone who comes here."" where the wealthy roam jackson also has proved increasingly popular with wealthy second-home owners, and upscale golf communities have grown around the region. longtime resident and former vice president dick cheney was joined by buyers such as financier charles schwab to golfer tiger woods, many of whom also came for the region's famed fly-fishing. all sorts of non-skiing activities are offered, including winter ""snowcoach"" tours of yellowstone and old faithful when the park is much less crowded. snowmobiling is incredibly popular, with numerous tour operators and rentals. nordic skiing is offered in several places, including guided trips into grand teton national park. another popular activity is the horse-drawn sleigh rides through the national elk refuge, winter home to thousands of elk, which you can view up-close. even the airport -- the nation's only commercial one within a national park -- has risen on the tides of the area's growth. two years ago it completed a $30million renovation and expansion that added new long-haul non-stop flights. one of the most accessible and user-friendly airports in skiing -- it's just 8 miles from town -- it is also more reliable, landing larger planes less affected by mountain weather. longtime resort president jerry blann is proud that the expansion has been done ""in a manner that's kept the spirit of jackson hole the way it's always been. ... we will never have  1-million-skier days, our guest experience will not become industrial, and we will never experience the sort of sprawl you see in other ski destinations",LIFE; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"Jackson Hole's golden anniversary; Majestic mountain gem turns 50, and the sky's the limit",11/25/16

" net neutrality rules, passed in february 2015 by the federal communications commission and supported by netflix, google and other big websites, prevent internet service providers (isps) from blocking and slowing the transmission of content. the contentious issue triggered lawsuits from the isps and drew an unprecedented outpouring of public comments. though net neutrality wasn't a constant topic for donald trump as a candidate, he has been an opponent of the regulations, calling the fcc's adoption ""a power grab"" by president obama in a tweet in 2014. the president-elect's latest appointments suggest he'll try to bolster that view, supported by telecommunication companies such as verizon and others, by reversing the rules. jeffrey eisenach, who joined trump's transition team in october, and mark jamison, a former lobbyist for sprint, were named monday as members of the ""agency landing"" team focusing on the fcc. both advisers opposed net neutrality. net neutrality ""is not about protecting consumers from rapacious internet service providers. ... net neutrality is crony capitalism pure and simple -- an effort by one group of private interests to enrich itself at the expense of another group by using the power of the state,"" eisenach wrote in 2014 in an article on the website of the american enterprise institute, a free enterprise think-tank where eisenach was a visiting scholar from 2012 to 2016. a recent new york times article noted that some of eisenach's work at the think-tank on fcc issues were supported by verizon and the gsma, a wireless trade group of which at&t and verizon are members. eisenach, who is the managing director and co-chair of communication, media and internet practice at nera economic consulting, declined to comment on the administration's plans. jamison has also taken swings at the obama administration's net neutrality stance. the fcc has pursued a ""unilateral approach"" on net neutrality and other rulemaking procedures that ""forces industry and consumers to incur unnecessary litigation costs and to operate in an uncertain environment,"" jamison said in an editorial last year. jamison, the director of the public utility research center at the university of florida, also declined to comment. the issue of net neutrality has divided telecom and tech companies for years. netflix, google, twitter and other household tech names back the fcc's need for authority to prevent isps from promoting their own content over that of other outlets. telecommunication giants such as at&t and verizon have countered, saying the agency used outdated authority given to public utilities that is more heavy-handed than needed to oversee the internet. their fight has gone to the courts. verizon successfully had the fcc's 2010 rules tossed out in its court challenge in 2014; at&t and others appealed a federal court's decision upholding the current rules. supporters of a less hands-on fcc see good signs. ""l do think the appointment of eisenach and jamison is an indication that president-elect trump is serious about achieving communications policy reform, including curtailing the reach of the agency's net neutrality,"" said randolph may, president of the free state foundation, a free market think-tank. in a washington times editorial monday, may said, ""it's undeniable that the obama administration's fcc has been on a regulatory binge, adopting a number of major overly burdensome and unduly costly new rules, despite the lack of evidence of market failure or consumer harm."" how could net neutrality be overturned? ""the new fcc could try to walk away from the rules. it could refuse to enforce them, try to wipe them off the books or stop defending them on appeal,"" said matt wood, policy director at free press, an awareness group that supported the rules. the strongest action would be congressional, may said, ""because it is more durable and can't be easily reversed."" new legislation could remove the fcc's oversight of the internet service providers as ""common carriers"" and the net itself as a public utility. the fcc based its new rules on authority from title ii of the communications act of 1934. ""republicans in both congress and the fcc have expressed their antipathy towards title ii regulation,"" research firm moffettnathanson said in a note to investors after the election. ""a congressional rollback of title ii was never a serious option in a democratic administration: president obama made clear that he stood ready with a veto. with the risk of a veto now gone, a legislative remedy now not only looks possible, but likely."" analysts craig moffett and michael nathanson said last week in a subsequent note, ""it is likely ... that virtually every major fcc rulemaking of the past four years will be undone."" net neutrality rules are very popular and drew a record number of comments at the fcc -- more than 4million, said chris lewis, vice president at public knowledge, a consumer tech advocacy group. perhaps the trump administration will offer a counterproposal, he said, because many congressional republicans were in favor of an open internet but against the fcc's net neutrality proposal. fcc chairman tom wheeler, when asked about possible reversal of the rules after the agency's monthly meeting last week, said, ""i think it's an important thing to remember that taking a fast, fair and open internet away from the public and from those who use it to offer services to the public would be a real mistake."" wheeler, a democrat, noted at the time that he serves as chairman at the pleasure of the president and could be replaced",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Net neutrality faces ax by Trump; Issue triggered lawsuits and drew public comments,11/25/16
" it's a big, comfortable, quiet, full-size sedan. the 2017 lacrosse has been redesigned to make it lighter, lower and wider -- and in the process buick certainly hopes it will be viewed as more youthful. but in the end, it remains the quintessential buick, a car that likely will score with older buyers who see it as a reward for life well lived, saving the smaller models and suvs for the younger image that the brand portrays in advertising. modernizing the flagship lacrosse couldn't come at a better time for buick. the general motors brand has been scoring points lately, both in the design of its concept cars and in its build quality. consumer reports recently named buick as the first domestic brand to reach the top three, behind lexus and toyota, in its annual list of reliability. as the flagship, lacrosse is, by its very nature, substantial. buick has done its best to slim it down in the name of better fuel economy, which is no easy feat. but it was necessary since lacrosse competes against a highly competitive field that includes cars like ford taurus, chrysler 300, nissan maxima, toyota avalon and hyundai azera, to name a few. adding to the pressure, car sales overall are down. lacrosse sales were down 37.1% for the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year, autodata reports, although that kind of drop is not unusual when a new version is in the wings. against that field, lacrosse holds its own. lacrosse puts the premium on how smooth it drives and the quietness of its cabin. where we noticed -- and appreciated -- the silence most was the stop-start function, common in cars now as a way of saving gas. we barely noticed when the car's engine turned off at stop lights or signs, then restarted when we pressed the gas pedal. that's a welcome change from the jarring experience in some cars. in the lacrosse, we barely noticed. some of the credit goes to lacrosse's 3.6-liter v-6 engine, which works in tandem with an eight-speed automatic transmission. the 305 horsepower it provided was plenty, though not an overabundance. what impressed us more was the fuel economy. we achieved 30 miles a gallon over 327 miles of mostly freeway driving, at the high end of the car's epa rating of 21 mpg in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway. after the weight reduction, gas mileage was boosted 3 mpg over the outgoing 2016 model. and in the premium version that we tested, there was no forgetting the plush touches expected of a buick. our model had the optional rear sunshade, part of the $1,550 power sunroof package. it also has a massage unit built into the seat, nice once you get used to the idea of mechanical fingers working on your lower back as you glide down the interstate. one more thing about that seat. it had gm's butt-thumping proximity alert system. so, for instance, it you get to close to another car or wall as you back up, your rear end gets thumped by the seat before the message can travel to your brain. we find it somewhat disconcerting, but at least it's less distracting to passengers in the car than a beep or some other audible warning. all told, between the options and the higher trim level, the model we tested came in at $47,370, including the $925 delivery charge, a big leap from lacrosse's base price of $33,915. it's a reasonable price given lacrosse's improvements and the competition. but we urge prospective lacrosse buyers to cross shop it against its corporate stablemate, chevrolet's impala, which has some of the same features and sharp looks to go with them. what stands out redesign: lower, wider, lighter quiet: stop-start is especially impressive fuel economy: 30 mpg as tested in a big car. wow! 2017 buick lacrosse what? a big, plush full-size car when? on sale now where? made in detroit how big? 16",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"Slimmed-down lacrosse makes a big impression; 2017 model is lighter, lower and wider -- but every bit as comfy, quiet and smooth as before",11/25/16

""in a digital world, we need to offer opportunities to try the real thing,"" klaus zellmer, ceo of porsche cars north america, explains in an interview. the german performance brand opens the center at a difficult time. porsche parent volkswagen group is undergoing cost-cutting measures in the wake of its diesel-emissions scandal, which is costing it billions in buybacks, court settlements and penalties. last week alone, vw group announced it will reduce its workforce by 30,000 worldwide. it doesn't help that the price tag for this latest porsche experience center came in far above earlier estimates and that it took twice as long to develop as expected. yet, with its dedication timed just after the los angeles auto show, the center could become a model for other automakers dealing with customers' increasing resistance to going to dealerships for test drives and the sometimes arduous task of completing a deal for a new car. the experience center won't sell new cars. rather, it will refer would-be customers to dealerships once their driving sessions pique their interest. what it provides is a deep dive into the capabilities of porsche vehicles, not to mention the brand's lore and history. it's far more than any dealer, with the typical drive around the block, could ever provide. the emphasis at the experience center will be about learning how to drive a porsche for maximum enjoyment under different conditions. there are even steep hilltops to teach macan and cayenne suv customers how to negotiate difficult terrain. students will take on any of eight ""training modules."" they include two curvy courses to see the car's ability to maneuver in action, a runway for straight-line acceleration, an ""ice hill"" and a slippery wet patch where the car's wheels lose contact with the surface. now, including carson, porsche will have five experience centers in the world. a sixth is on the way next year in shanghai. but carson, second in the u.s",MONEY; Pg. 3B,USA TODAY,"At Porsche track, potential buyers can let it loose",11/25/16
" companies are expected to spend $780 million buying back their stock next year, a 30% jump from 2016, as investors predict president-elect donald trump will pass tax breaks allowing companies to ""repatriate"" or bring back cash to u.s. shores, according to a report this week from goldman sachs. stock buybacks are expected to be the largest way companies will spend the $2.6 trillion in excess cash they'll have next year, says the report co-authored by goldman's chief u.s. equity strategist david kostin. buybacks would rise just 5% without the expected tax breaks. understanding how companies will use their massive and growing pile of cash, much of which is overseas, is of utmost importance to investors and workers. companies in the standard & poor's 500 will likely boost their cash spending by 12% next year. that's largely due to an expectation republicans will approve a one-time tax break that will allow u.s. companies to bring foreign profits back home. but much of the cash won't go to new investments in plant and equipment, but find its way back into the pockets of investors, goldman says. of the $200 billion expected to be brought back to the u.s., $150 billion will likely go back to investors as stock buybacks. additionally, goldman estimates u.s. companies will leave $800 billion overseas even after the tax holiday. stock buybacks, where companies use cash to buy their own stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding, can drive values higher by spreading profits over fewer shares. companies, though, have other competing demands for cash including paying bigger dividends, investing in their operations or buying other firms. given the track record of companies in recent years and their behavior during a previous tax holiday in 2004 that allowed them to bring cash back to the u.s. without triggering a big tax, buybacks will win out, goldman says. ""for only the second time in 20 years, buybacks will account for the largest share of total (standard & poor's) 500 cash use,"" the report says. specifically, goldman estimates tax reform under president trump to encourage companies to bring $200 billion of the $1 trillion they have stored overseas back home. much of the increase hinges on wide speculation the republican-controlled white house and congress will move quickly to give u.s. companies a temporary tax holiday in the second half of 2017,  forecasts goldman sachs' economist alec phillips. buybacks will grow much faster than the other uses of cash, goldman says, if the tax holiday rules pass. spending on capital improvements to companies' plants and equipment is seen rising just 6% to $710 billion, and research and development is expected to rise just 7% to $290 billion. goldman sees cash spent on mergers and acquisitions rising a relatively meager 5% to $335 billion and dividends to rise just 6% to $460 billion. proposed tax breaks for cash stored overseas is potentially a major shift in policy. currently, profits of u.s",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,CASH GRAB; How companies plan to spend $2.6T,11/25/16
" wade anniversary. that's the month in 1973 the supreme court used a fake law to create a fake right to kill our own offspring, and a body count that has now reached well over 50 million began. each january, this mass demonstration rarely gets more than perfunctory coverage by major u.s. newspapers, cable news networks and broadcast news. however, last weekend a few blocks away from the site of the march, the meeting of a couple hundred racists trying to rebrand themselves as the ""alt-right"" received days of coverage. type ""march for life"" into google news and 4.6 million results come up. that's a pretty hefty number until you type in ""alt right"" and see it returns more than 6 million. how come a term most of us hadn't heard of, until the just-concluded 2016 presidential election, gets more attention than a national protest that is older than google itself? talk about your fake news. but a different kind of fake news spread on social media is what a growing chorus of journalists, liberals and tech leaders at least partially blame for donald trump's election victory. satire partisanship for most americans, it's hardly a new phenomenon. it has been going on for quite some time, actually: dan rather's fake gotcha story on george w. bush during the 2004 election. abc news' failure to disclose ties between george stephanopoulos and hillary clinton before his fake interview about the clinton foundation. the more than 24 ""journalists"" who took their fake objectivity with them to work in the obama administration. when cnn, pbs newshour,  the washington post, slate and many others thought fake news was kinda cool because the fake news was written by liberal comedians for cable satire shows. there's a difference between the deliberate fakery that fueled trump and journalistic failures, but it hard for the public to distinguish when so much hackery and partisanship slips through. and it is not just trump backers who are disillusioned. according to gallup, since 1997 trust in the news media among independents has fallen from 53% to 30%. among democrats, it has fallen from 64% to 51%. as a result, we've gone from adults telling their kids, ""don't trust what you read on the internet,"" to ""did you hear ted cruz's dad killed kennedy? @trumpjesus posted it on twitter."" i know firsthand yes, the trump campaign shamelessly rode a wave of fake news sites to help it corral a gullible public. i know firsthand because i spent much of the republican primary combating this plague as a nationally syndicated conservative talk show host. it got so bad that for months, we chose to take listener phone calls only sparingly because we'd spend more time talking about things that didn't happen than things that did. for example, former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski once shared a fake story about folks being paid to protest trump. trump himself wondered aloud why notorious tabloid the national enquirer hasn't won a pulitzer. one of its latest headlines is ""cher's shoe obsession: the ugly early years."" but a gullible populace doesn't appear overnight. it has to be cultivated and cultured by years of journalistic malpractice and malfeasance. there have to be years of mystifying decisions such as the ones to treat a few hundred racists as blockbuster news while relegating tens of thousands of pro-life protesters to the briefs column. at that point, very few trust the reporting of objective facts if they're reported by a source that has proved itself to be anything but objective. not to mention that our friends on the left, who are most of the people working in the mainstream news media, can't have it both ways. when you advocate allowing people to redefine reality to the point that it is controversial and ""hateful"" to expect people to use the proper bathroom, don't be surprised if people want to decide for themselves which ""news"" is actually real, too. if i can claim my own gender and my own pronouns, why can't i claim my own facts? don't be surprised when folks can't tell the difference between real and fake news when too many of the people working in our newsrooms can't, either",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Who left us vulnerable to fake news?; Real journalists who lost the trust of conservatives and liberals alike,11/25/16
" we have seen only a few of president-elect donald trump's choices. among the choices generating strong opposition has been sen. jeff sessions, r-ala., for the post of attorney general. sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., wasted no time calling on trump to rescind this nomination. while such expressions might be comforting to the demoralized base of the democratic party, sessions is unlikely to be the most unpalatable of the many choices trump will be making in the next few months, and democrats would do well not to waste their ammunition on someone who's likely to be confirmed with or without the votes of democratic senators. much of the consternation around sessions has to do with the post to which trump proposes to nominate him. the justice department has jurisdiction over contentious issues that range from the enforcement of voting rights laws to immigration and intellectual property. as a member of the senate judiciary committee and a former u.s. attorney, sessions is professionally qualified. what seems to have ignited opposition is the fact that he was denied confirmation as a federal judge in 1986 after he was nominated by president reagan. at the time, witnesses accused sessions of making racist comments. elected in 1996 to the very senate that had rejected him, sessions established himself as one of the most conservative members of the upper chamber, but he never adopted the abrasive style that was later to characterize sen. ted cruz of texas. and at a time when even being seen in the company of democrats might provoke a primary challenge from the right, sessions partnered with one of the most liberal members of the senate, richard durbin of illinois, to reform the  visa program that favors foreigners with high-tech skills. sessions strongly opposes illegal immigration and opposes recent efforts in congress to reform immigration law. all of these efforts, in one form or other, grant amnesty to certain groups of individuals who reside in the country without proper documentation. this is a political position that might be excessively, even narrowly, legalistic. nonetheless, it is not a form of bigotry, although it is seen as such by many liberals who are now clamoring for sessions' rejection by the senate. they have even seized on his middle name -- beauregard -- much the way some on the right chose to emphasize the hussein in obama's name, suggesting that the nominee is somehow connected to confederate gen. p.g.t. beauregard. there may well be individuals down the road whose records offer real cause for alarm on the part of senate democrats. the sessions nomination is not terrain worth dying to defend. ross k",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,"Senate Democrats, pick your Trump battle",11/25/16

" he had a miniature crowbar for cracking the locks on file cabinets filled with selective service system records. and he understood -- standing there in his underwear -- that his life was over. horrigan and his antiwar confederates were burgling buffalo's old post office building on a steamy august night in 1971. they'd shed their clothes because it was hot as hades in the dust-cloaked attic where they'd hidden for hours until nightfall. they'd emerged with their faces streaked in grime, like lenten ashes, and felt giddy exhilaration as their scheme unfolded precisely as they'd planned -- until that moment when they saw those refracted red lights, pulsing like a telltale heart on the stonework. now police stormed in, guns drawn, their shouts ricocheting off the cavernous stone walls. a pair of armed fbi agents, who'd been called away from a summer party, arrived in bermuda shorts and sandals. and the buffalo five, as they'd soon be known, were quickly thrown to the terrazzo floor, placed in handcuffs and arrested. this peculiar tableau of trespassers caught with their pants down and federal agents in tourist attire called to mind a mix of monty python and inspector clouseau, popular comedic stylings of the era. but this was no joke: federal charges beckoned. prison terms loomed. and they hadn't even gotten to destroy any draft records. the buffalo courier-express trumpeted news of the arrests. horrigan's name wasn't there. he'd given it to the cops as joe hill, for a turn-of-the-century labor activist. that would keep the truth from horrigan's father for a few more precious hours. jack horrigan was a familiar name as the buffalo bills' vice president for public relations and a confidant to their star running back, o.j. simpson. this is a story of fathers and sons, war and peace, firstborns and second chances -- and of a formidable federal judge who allowed a band of bohemian dissidents to represent themselves and put the vietnam war on trial. it all happened at a time not unlike today, when competing ideologies in a fractured, fractious country believed their side owned the moral high ground and a proprietary purchase on patriotism. the buffalo five -- three men, two women -- are as old as 71 now. john t. curtin, the u.s. district court judge who presided over their trial, is 95. he sent a retirement letter to president obama last spring, ending a remarkable 48-year tenure that included some of the most important cases in western new york history, including school desegregation in buffalo and love canal in niagara falls. but few cases in curtin's career would unfold more unconventionally than the trial of the buffalo five. usa today sports talked to curtin and four of the five former defendants, including horrigan, a retired reporter at a skein of small-town newspapers in new york and author of an unpublished memoir called fortunate son: a dying father, an angry son and the war on the home front. 'that's all i had to hear' horrigan graduated from canisius high school in 1968, in the same class with tim russert, future washington bureau chief of nbc news, and anthony yerkovich, future creator of miami vice. three weeks before their commencement, antiwar activists in catonsville, md., burned draft records with homemade napalm. horrigan enrolled at fordham where he eventually found himself drawn to a subculture of the american antiwar movement known in the newspapers as the catholic left. he began spending time at a church rectory in the bronx where war resisters took inspiration from the so-called catonsville nine. the nine included catholic clergy, notably brothers daniel and philip berrigan, later styled as ""rebel priests"" on the cover of time. (daniel was a jesuit, philip a josephite.) their trial was national news. so were their convictions. and their brazen act of civil disobedience gave rise to a national escalation of antiwar marches, sit-ins and flaming draft cards horrigan dropped out of fordham after his sophomore year and returned to buffalo in the summer of 1971 to participate in a daring draft board raid, thrilled at the notion of destroying the records of men he'd known as boys in hopes this would keep hundreds out of the war. the five walked into the old post office during business hours and hid in the attic, waiting for the building to close and darkness to come. the men stripped down to t-shirts and tighty-whiteys, the women to t-shirts and shorts, and not solely because of the hours they'd spend in an attic sweatbox. they also worried the rustle of pant legs brushing and shoes clacking could echo in the building. police would find seven pairs of shoes at the scene of the crime because the five was really seven. two men managed to sneak out and dash into the night. hours later, from his jail cell, horrigan thought about the terrible arguments he'd had with his father over the war. but there was no anger in the air when his father paid his  bail. ""he said, 'you're my son and i love you,'"" horrigan recalls. ""and that's all i had to hear."" 'must find them guilty' the buffalo five argued their non-violent action was justified in the face of an unjust war. curtin denied their application to subpoena president nixon but allowed them unusual leeway: witnesses for the defense included former american troops  who'd fought in the war, a vietnamese woman whose village had been destroyed, academics from the fields of history and theology. defense attorney vincent e. doyle jr., appointed by curtin as co-counsel, said the five's non-violent action targeted paper, not people. assistant u.s. attorney james w. grable said the five broke the law and admitted it. curtin's charge to the jury was stark: ""if you find the defendants committed acts as charged in the indictment, you must find them guilty of those acts."" the verdict: guilty of conspiracy to destroy draft records and intent to commit third-degree burglary, not guilty of removing records from a military intelligence office. horrigan's girlfriend, patty, learned in the weeks after the verdict that she was pregnant. she and horrigan were the only ones in the courtroom at sentencing who knew. curtin told the five their love of country was greater than most citizens because they'd put their moral outrage into action. but he said the jeopardy in which they'd placed themselves and others outweighed any good they'd hoped to achieve. then he sentenced each to one year in prison. but quickly curtin said something else. he was suspending the sentences. each of the peace activists would be placed on one year's probation. it took a moment for this to sink in. shouts of joy rang out in the crowded courtroom. 'a second chance' curtin shares a cozy condo with jane, his wife of 64 years. he is asked about that day, half a lifetime ago, when he placed the buffalo five on probation. a leprechaun's smile -- amused and pleased -- washes over his irish features. his health is precarious these days, but the jaunty grin renders him momentarily young again.

""brig. gen. king was reprimanded for failing to take appropriate action to respond to and mitigate lapses in safety and protocol while serving as commander of dugway proving ground,"" lt. col. jennifer johnson, an army spokeswoman, said in a statement. command of operations at dugway was also transferred to the edgewood biological center at aberdeen, md. personnel from edgewood have been destroying dugway's toxins, ensuring decontamination of its labs and ensuring future use of deadly agents there follows new safety protocols, johnson said. the moves are likely the final steps in the army's attempt to sweep clean the anthrax mess and hold accountable the officials responsible for it. nine civilians were demoted, suspended or lost supervisory responsibilities following an investigation and stinging report. another soldier, whose name was not disclosed by the army, was also disciplined. the army's actions stem from problems with what pentagon refers to as the ""high-risk, zero-defects world of biological select agents program."" last year, the centers for disease control and prevention and the army found that the military had mistakenly sent live anthrax spores over a 12-year period to 194 laboratories in 50 states, the district of columbia, three u.s. territories and nine foreign countries. concentrations of live anthrax in the samples were low, public health was not at risk, and nobody was sickened, an army investigation found. the samples were sent to labs to help them calibrate detection equipment and to help devise countermeasures to the toxin. if inhaled, live anthrax spores can be lethal. the army blasted the poor lab practices and a ""culture of complacency"" at dugway. it recommended that the soldiers and civilians involved be held ""accountable for their failures."" some of the problems investigators found at dugway: officials appointed a biosafety officer who lacked training and education for the job; failure to conduct routine tests on surfaces to ensure pathogens hadn't been spread outside secure cabinets; and staff who ""regularly manipulated data"" certifying pathogens being shipped were safe for use without special protective equipment. after the news of the bungled handling of dangerous pathogens broke, the cdc suspended dugway from producing anthrax for export to other labs. the report singled out king for criticism, saying in the report that he had ""repeatedly deflected blame and minimized the severity of the incidents."" moreover, it found king lacked introspection and that he failed to recognize the scope and severity of the incidents that occurred during his command at dugway. despite the problems at dugway, king was promoted to general and currently commands the 20th chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive command at the army's aberdeen proving ground in maryland. king, who commanded dugway as a colonel from july 2009 to july 2010, was not available for comment. a 2015 usa today network investigation discovered hundreds of additional accidents with dangerous pathogens at corporate, university, government and military labs nationwide",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,Army disciplines general over anthrax debacle; Final steps are taken in effort to hold officers accountable,11/25/16

""you have 300 days to shop throughout the year. why do you pick thanksgiving?"" the mall of america stayed shuttered this holiday. cbl & associates properties inc. planned to close 72 of its 89 malls this thanksgiving after keeping them open the past three years, and electronics chain hhgregg closed all of its 220 stores. but most major retailers decided to continue this newest tradition of kicking off the holiday shopping marathon right after -- or even before -- the thanksgiving feast. toys r us, for instance, opened its doors at 5 p.m. on the holiday and will keep its stores open for 30 hours straight. jon hart of asheville, n.c., has been a holiday shopping ""door buster"" for a decade. this year he headed to a best buy before the store opened. hart points to a positive shift in customer service.

""it expresses how much of your income is set aside for those debt payments every month,"" said wallethub analyst jill gonzalez. ""if a debt-to-income ratio is high, then yes, we suggested a lower holiday budget in order for consumers maintain control over their finances."" pocketbook pundits will tell you that it's key to include all your holiday expenses -- gifts, entertainment, family meals, flowers, decorations, class donations for teachers, you name it -- in that holiday budget. we all know we're not just pulling out our wallets in november and december only for sweaters and video games. all is not high-stakes during the holidays. sometimes, it's ok to do something goofy, instead of just burning through two or three paychecks trying to buy the perfect gifts. create a completely fun tradition to fill in the gaps. we've got a thanksgiving day trivia game. i make up totally whacked-out questions on thanksgiving day, usually when watching the parade, and give out the worst knickknacks we want to unload as prizes. sometimes, we spring for a few lottery tickets and claim we're offering a chance to win millions. it's savvy to add fiscally responsible entertainment into the mix where it's more about the camaraderie than the cash. draft your own  santa clause. put a special provision in your holiday contract that protects you from going overboard or digging into a deeper financial hole. maybe it means you won't put more than $100 or $200 on your credit card this holiday. maybe it means you'll only spend cash. maybe it means a loved one can nag all they want but you're vowing that you won't rush around on black friday to nab an xbox one s for $249 or less. being merry -- and not wary -- for the holidays could require a whole new game plan",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,"How to avoid spending too much on holiday gifts; The average American will spend almost $1,000 -- but that may not be realistic for you",11/25/16

" the conclusion from the australian transport safety bureau made public wednesday is based on analysis of 20 pieces of debris believed to have come from the boeing 777. pieces of debris have washed ashore on the east and south coast of africa, the east coast of madagascar and the islands of mauritius, reunion and rodriguez since the plane disappeared march 8, 2014, during a flight from kuala lumpur, malaysia, to beijing. two sections of flaps were traced specifically to the lost plane by their markings. damage to pieces of the wings suggest the flaps ""most likely"" weren't deployed as they would be in a controlled glide for landing, according to the bureau's 27-page report. for takeoff and landing, flaps are extended from the wing along tracks, with the extra surface area and angle of the wing helping lift or slow the plane. investigators found the damage  suggested that the flaps were still retracted when the plane entered the water -- key evidence indicating the flaps did not deploy. ""the right outboard flap was most likely in the retracted position at the time it separated from the wing,"" the report said. ""the right flaperon was probably at, or close to, the neutral position at the time it separated from the wing."" peter foley, the bureau's director of search operations for the plane, told reporters wednesday that the new analysis ""means the aircraft wasn't configured for a landing or a ditching."" ""you can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control,"" foley said.

" welcome, the crown. the british  upstairs-downstairs soap opera has disappeared into the mists of time. now comes netflix's glittery the crown to fill up the bottomless reservoir of fascination with the british royal windsors. queen elizabeth ii -- the oldest (90) and longest-serving monarch (64 years and counting) in british history -- is the focus of netflix's the crown, due friday. unlike downton,  the crown is a  (mostly) true story about real people, some of them still very much alive, and possibly fretting: what could writer/producer peter morgan (the queen)  be up to in his latest compelling dramatization of the windsor story? ""you can never tell how it goes down"" at the palace, morgan says. ""i'm sure there are a lot of things the royal family prefer me not to write about. but when you give people the option to tell their version of their own life, you often end up with a bland, photoshopped version of reality."" not so in the crown. netflix has reportedly spent more than $100 million on the series, and it shows. the clothes, the jewels, the palaces, horses and fine art; even the poisonous london fog and the dreary, shabby look of the city after world war ii are deftly re-created. morgan mostly gets the history right. sally bedell smith, acclaimed biographer of the queen,  says nitpickers should get over it. ""peter wants to get all the contextual details just right, visual as well as factual, and then he applies his creative imagination,""  smith says. ""as sheer drama ... it's a cut above downton abbey, but it's going to scratch the itch that people have after that ended."" part royal romance, part primer on the british constitution, the crown is as much about the delicate minuet between monarch and prime minister as it is about the cheers and tears of royal life. the 10-episode season follows 21-year-old princess elizabeth (claire foy) from her marriage to dashing prince philip (matt smith) in 1947 to the  death of her beloved father, george vi (jared harris), her accession in 1952, her coronation in 1953 and the constitutional and emotional crisis in which she stops  younger sister princess margaret's  marriage to a divorced man in 1955. for the mostly british cast, the crown has been a learning experience.  foy, smith and harris say they gained new respect and affection for the royals. the earnest and dutiful queen buckles down to the new job thrust upon her earlier than expected, painfully aware of the inadequacies of her education and determined, like her father, to do her best at playing the role of symbol of a 1,000-year-old monarchy. ""it's a charged time for her, coming to the throne and becoming the head of state is a unique, odd kind experience ... especially as she's still grieving for her father,"" foy says. the crown's queen catches on quickly to her new role,  recognizing the machinations of both palace courtiers and government ministers such as crafty winston churchill (john lithgow), who's fading physically but fighting to hold on to power. more than six decades later, she has outlasted  12 prime ministers and is more popular than ever",LIFE; Pg. 1D,USA TODAY,'The Crown' tells a glittering story; Netflix's new series is latest to tap into that royal obsession,11/3/16

" early holiday hiring could stoke job growth in this week's employment report, some economists say, despite a payroll processor's estimate wednesday that gains were disappointing again in october. adp said businesses added 147,000 jobs last month, below the 165,000  economists expected. it forecast the labor department on friday will record 175,000 new jobs in the public and private sectors in the final employment report before the election. democrat hillary clinton could cite a solid report as further evidence of steady gains during the obama administration, while republican donald trump could point to a weak payroll total as a sign of a sluggish labor market. although adp tries to foreshadow labor's private-sector total, it has missed by an average 46,000 a month over the past two years, according to high frequency economics. for september, adp was close to the mark, initially estimating businesses added 154,000 jobs, while labor counted 167,000. average monthly job gains have slowed this year to 178,000 from 229,000 in 2015, according to labor's figures, a downshift many economists anticipated in light of a near-normal 5% unemployment rate that's providing employers with fewer qualified candidates. payroll growth fell short of estimates in august and september, with gains of 167,000 and 156,000, respectively. but retail stores have hired seasonal employees earlier this year to compete with their online counterparts who have beefed up their warehouse staffs, says economist diane swonk, who heads ds economics. as a result, she says, some hiring that typically would occur in november was pulled forward a month. ""they didn't want to wait too long because they were afraid there wouldn't be anybody left,"" says swonk, who predicts labor will announce 190,000 payroll gains in october. the development, however, could slow seasonal hiring this month. outplacement firm challenger, gray and christmas estimates retailers will bring on about 739,000 holiday workers in the final three months of the year, matching 2015. other indicators also point to sturdy job totals for october, economist andrew hunter of capital economics says. those include initial jobless claims -- a gauge of layoffs -- that are near 40-year lows, service-sector hiring that recently hit an 11-year high and a sharp rise in temporary employment in september, hunter says. employers often add temporary workers before expanding their permanent staffs. at the same time, some economists and public companies have cited business uncertainty surrounding the presidential election that has led some firms to defer hiring and investment until the vote provides a clearer view on tax and other policies. the federal reserve is likely to scrutinize labor's payroll surveys for november and december as it weighs an expected interest rate hike at a mid-december meeting. the fed has kept its key rate unchanged since lifting in late 2015 for the first time in nine years. in september, adp said, small businesses added 34,000 jobs, midsize ones 48,000, and large companies 64,000. professional and business services led the gains, with 69,000. leisure and hospitality added 38,000, and health care 34,000. construction companies cut 15,000 jobs and manufacturers, still coping with the oil downturn and a weak global economy, trimmed 1,000. adp vice president ahu yildirmaz said job growth ""appears to be shifting from small to large companies"" because of the lessening impact of the sluggish global economy, which hammered bigger firms earlier in the year",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Holiday hiring may influence jobs report; ADP: 147,000 jobs added in October, but other signs point to stronger gains",11/3/16
" but even if this quest is successful, trump's candidacy has exposed rifts that will only grow more jagged if, as appears likely, voters reward republicans with another house majority. if you lived through the 1990s, you don't need a reminder of what it looks like when a republican congress obsesses over any excuse to take out a clinton presidency. but you're getting one anyway. the next clinton hasn't even been elected, and some conservatives already are speculating about impeaching her. fbi director james comey's letter to congress last week, announcing the discovery of more emails that might be relevant to the fbi probe of clinton's private server, left mad libs-style blanks for republicans to fill in their own crimes. this proved to be the perfect chum for house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz. ""case reopened,"" he eagerly tweeted. and just as he hoped, the news firestorm began. suddenly, an inevitable win for clinton along with a democratic senate and gains in the house now seemed far less inevitable, and canada began to secure its southern border. most likely to obstruct chaffetz withdrew his backing for trump after the ""hot mic"" access hollywood tape revealed the self-alleged billionaire bragging about assaulting women. ""we have a 15-year-old daughter,"" chaffetz told cnn. ""do you think i can look her in the eye and tell her that i endorsed donald trump for president?"" but chaffetz soon decided that indeed he could, the better to embark on ""years"" of investigations of hillary clinton -- much of it reruns of what we've already seen from the first eight or so committees that investigated the tragedy in benghazi, libya. meanwhile, in the senate, ted cruz -- fearful that he might lose his title as ""most likely to obstruct"" -- is building the case to block any appointment to the supreme court until there's a republican president. why not add four years to a supreme court vacancy that's already setting records? heck, why not just amend the constitution to say only republicans should be allowed to govern while democrats stick to  making the tv shows, music and movies republicans love? if they take their eyes off the villain, republicans may recognize that they're headed for a civil war that resembles sears catalog models acting out the shootout scene at the end of quentin tarantino's reservoir dogs. (spoiler: everyone dies.) stan collender, the editor of the capitol games and gains blog, has predicted that house speaker paul ryan could lose his job even before the end of this year. ryan was reluctant to endorse trump and decided that he would not ""defend"" the nominee in the aftermath of the access hollywood video. that puts him at odds with trump, the party base and three dozen tea party conservatives in the house freedom caucus -- which reportedly met ""secretly"" wednesday to discuss ryan's future. winning by losing the only way republicans can avoid this unhappy schism is to lose the house. if they keep it, america gets the gift of never-ending investigations into never-ending investigations, and the base gets to maim the career of the man who was once considered its great hope. if they keep the senate as well, and clinton wins, the supreme court goes on in its stunted state. if they win the white house, expect lawsuits against the dozen women who have accused their new president of sexual assault. every time trump offends another minority group, analysts dust off the republican national committee ""autopsy"" report from 2013 where the party tried to remind itself to stop alienating the minority voters it needs to win over most. the  section on women gets much less attention. but it said the rnc must improve its efforts to include female voters. yet trump is doing much worse than mitt romney did in 2012. the embrace of trump is a clear sign that defeating a clinton is far more important than any outreach the party once knew it needed to do. as an institution, the gop paid no real cost for the endless investigations and ponderous impeachment of president bill clinton. but in the end, even captain ahab eventually ended up with the line from his harpoon around his neck",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,GOP should hope to lose the house; It's the only way to save the party and spare the country a 1990s flashback,11/3/16

" could this election go into overtime? we can't rule it out and, in this environment, it could rip the country apart. trump regularly complains  of ""rigged"" elections to whip up his supporters. this is where a real nightmare for america's democracy could unfold. what if the initial tally on election night favors trump but as more votes are counted in the following days, the results shift in clinton's favor? it does not take too much imagination to predict that trump would be outraged, with an emphasis on rage. a democratic shift from election night to the final tally of votes is predictable. all states count some ballots late, and those tend to break towards democrats. nothing nefarious occurs: the casting and counting follow procedures laid out in state law. some of the states that count more late ballots are key battlegrounds, intensifying the suspense on election night. many states require mail ballots to be received on election day. others continue to accept ballots postmarked on election day, up to two weeks after the election. among these  are iowa, north carolina and ohio. then there are provisional ballots. states are required under federal law to provide them to anyone with a problem at the polls -- a voter who doesn't have the required form of id, or who recently moved, or whose name is missing from the voter registration rolls. election officials review provisional ballots and allow voters to clarify their eligibility after election day. in the four states that report separate results for provisional ballots, the voters who cast them broke strongly for the democrats in 2012. so if the presidential race is particularly close, provisional ballots could tilt it. now imagine trump has a slight initial lead in ohio, and this state puts him over the 270 electoral votes he needs to win. trump might declare himself the president-elect and attack the dishonest media for failing to anoint him. as election results shift in clinton's direction, as would be expected given the character of the ballots counted late, he would rail at republican ohio secretary of state jon husted -- who has said that he's voting for trump -- as fixing the election for clinton. if clinton eventually emerged the winner, then all hell would break loose. the unofficial prayer of election officials is ""please let it be a landslide, or at least a decisive margin."" when 140 million people do anything, including voting, it is only human nature that some things go wrong. these blemishes are magnified out of proportion when an election is close. in 2000, the boogeyman was the hanging chad. in 2016, the gremlin could be provisional ballots. for all our sakes, and for the legitimacy of american democracy, let's hope that this is merely a cautionary tale. michael p",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"For democracy's sake, pray election isn't close",11/3/16

""plus i don't see his harsh rhetoric and take-no-prisoners negotiating style working with strong-willed legislators. relations with allies in europe and asia could seriously deteriorate, and china, with its large u.s. treasury holdings, would be very anxious."" 2. a democratic sweep financial pain would also likely be felt if clinton takes the white house and democrats retake control of the senate and house of representatives, although odds still favor the gop holding the house. ""a democratic sweep is a tail risk,"" says andy laperriere, head of u.s. policy research for cornerstone macro. an election hat trick would enable democrats to take fuller control of the legislative process, making it easier for clinton to push through her less business-friendly platform of higher taxes on the rich and investors, more regulation of businesses and spending programs. wall street prefers  political ""gridlock"" where legislative decisions related to trade, immigration, taxes, health care and regulation are made with input from both  parties.

""this paradox is what drives us. work is about people and teams of people."" microsoft shares slipped 0.6% to $59.43 wednesday. shares hit an all-time high of more than $60 last month following a quarterly report that was better than investors expected. nadella is almost three years into a stewardship marked by a mission to transform the storied tech company from software peddler to a nimble cloud-first business focused on the needs of business enterprises. microsoft teams looks an awful lot like slack, which was founded in 2013 by stewart butterfield. the resemblance was so pointed that san francisco-based slack took out a full page advertisement in the new york times on wednesday, offering some ""friendly advice."" in both cases, the platforms give teams of workers the ability to keep a running thread of text-based chatter that can be archived. the idea is that an employee can get up to speed quickly on a group's progress by reading through a list of recent messages. slack's boom was due in part to email's evolution from novelty to tyranny, with in-boxes often overwhelmed with a mix of important and useless communications. microsoft's initial stab at enterprise-based communications tool came with its 2012 purchase of yammer for $1.2 billion. but the standalone service never caught fire, and its shortcomings were highlighted by the sudden popularity of slack's service. while yammer enterprise goes away with the advent of teams, yammer itself will remain integrated with office 365. but by having the ceo announce teams, microsoft is signaling that it now hopes to provide its business customers with a solution that's on a par with slack. teams is launching in preview mode in 181 countries and in 18 localized languages. the service, which will be made available to the small businesses and larger enterprises using office 365, won't be generally available until the first quarter of 2017. microsoft says it has 85 million monthly active users for office 365 on the commercial side of its business. for its part, slack says 4 million people are using its service daily, up from 3 million as recently as may. and more than 33,000 teams in companies large and small are using slack. patrick moorhead, analyst with moor insights & strategy, applauded microsoft for challenging slack at its own game and announcing a product that was ready for a global rollout. ""unlike previous office threats, microsoft is getting ahead of the curve and not waiting for services like slack to siphon off meaningful customers like google for work, now gsuite, did in the early days,"" he said. he said teams incorporates microsoft's previous acquisitions such as skype and yammer and takes advantage of its continuing work on machine-learning bots. if microsoft can keep up with the kind of services that work on slack and maintain its office 365 pricing model, ""slack could likely be at risk of decreased growth as they no longer have a giant utility lead,"" he said. microsoft had slack in its crosshairs, according to an unnamed source quoted by techcrunch. microsoft reportedly considered an $8 billion bid for slack last winter before pulling out in part because of opposition from co-founder bill gates. similar to slack, under microsoft teams, groups at work will be able to organize themselves into channels, or private groups. one channel, say, could be for marketers who are collaborating on a product launch. in group chats, teams will let employees employ emojis, stickers, gifs and custom memes. and teammates can keep everything out in the open or as need be go private. ""beyond delivering modern chat capabilities we also think about microsoft teams as really being quite deeply integrated into office itself, as a hub for teamwork,"" says kirk koenigsbauer, microsoft's corporate vice president for office. that means giving collaborators easy access to word, excel, powerpoint, sharepoint, onedrive for business, yammer, skype and other programs. microsoft also promises support for bots out of the gate.

""absent substantial shocks, they're set on december,"" says ubs economist drew matus. among potential shocks are a contested presidential election next week or a victory by republican donald trump that roils markets, economist paul ashworth of capital economics says. after wednesday's statement was released, fed fund futures reckoned there was a 72% chance the fed will lift its benchmark rate at a dec. 13-14 meeting, up from 68% a day earlier. it was unlikely the fed would act just days before the election, potentially disrupting markets and coloring perceptions of the economy and presidential candidates trump and hillary clinton. the fed has stood pat since raising its federal funds rate in december for the first time in nine years, citing factors such as china's economic slowdown, the united kingdom's brexit vote,  volatile markets and a spring slump in u.s",MONEY; Pg. 4B,USA TODAY,"Interest rates stay put, but door open for December hike",11/3/16
" but perhaps the biggest change is the addition of upfront pricing and arrival time predictions pegged to each level of uber service. more than just eliminating  price shock , the feature could begin steering more consumers toward uber's carpool option, uberpool.

""we're looking to give you time, calm, joy and money."" the new app will also, over the coming weeks, add features aimed at making the trip itself more productive and entertaining. dubbed the uber feed, the app's scrolling litany of offerings will include ubereats dining suggestions based on eateries that would be able to deliver a meal close to your arrival time. it will also have the ability to use snapchat filters to alert friends of your arrival time. and it will fetch details about the music playing in the car if the driver is streaming from pandora. kalanick brushed off a suggestion that, much like general motors' new partnership with ibm watson to turn the car via onstar into a rolling marketplace, uber could eventually sell to its users via the app. ""if you look at our business model, we're not in the advertising game,"" said kalanick, whose company has been valued at $68billion based on taking a percentage of each fare generated by its independent contractor drivers. ""it doesn't rule out an advertising model in the future, where maybe we tell you about a sale going on at the store you're heading to,"" he says.

" the series looked at waukesha county in wisconsin, chester county in pennsylvania, wayne county in michigan, maricopa county in arizona, union county in iowa, larimer county in colorado, clark county in ohio and hillsborough county in florida. america's next president will be the product of a contest with no parallel in modern times. it has featured the most unpopular nominees in polling history, the nastiest debates in decades, late-breaking bombshells, a gop ""civil war,"" surprising shifts in the election map and the newest fault line in u.s. politics: the ""education gap"" between trump and clinton voters. in this final story of a series, we revisit eight counties for clues of insights about next tuesday: 1. waukesha county, an iconic gop stronghold in the milwaukee suburbs, has never quite warmed to donald trump, highlighting one of his biggest obstacles against hillary clinton. for much of this race, the democratic nominee has been getting more support from her party's voters (just under 90% nationally) than he has from his (just over 80%). when we talked to habitual republicans in  wisconsin's third-largest county, we found widespread qualms about trump's temperament, political depth and conservatism. that's a stark reversal of form, since waukesha has been growing more republican (compared with the rest of the country) with every presidential race for 40 years. trump's weakness in the gop's high-turnout suburban base has offset his strength in more rural and blue-collar parts of wisconsin, and it has complicated his push to ""flip"" a state that has voted democratic for president seven times in a row. election night clue: whether trump gets the huge margins and turnouts his party needs from reliably red suburbs in metro battlegrounds like milwaukee, charlotte and cincinnati. 2. republicans have won over white college graduates in every presidential race since 1956. that streak may end next week, because of an education gap that has become the demographic hallmark of the clinton-trump election. no group has swung more sharply toward democrats since the last presidential race than white college-educated women. they voted republican four years ago but now favor clinton by large margins, a trend exacerbated by the recording of trump's sexual boasting and allegations of misconduct from women. the fallout is being felt in such suburban battlegrounds as northern virginia, north carolina's research triangle and the philadelphia suburbs, where we spoke with many voters -- even those mistrustful of clinton -- who were dismayed by trump's tone and rhetoric. chester county has the highest share of college-educated adults in pennsylvania. unlike waukesha, it has been growing less republican over time, not more -- a trend in many white-collar suburbs that ring large cities. chester was decided by less than a point in 2012. a recent statewide poll by bloomberg politics showed clinton with a 28-point lead in philadelphia's suburban counties, home to almost 3million people. election night clue: whether clinton does better than obama did in purple, high-education counties like jefferson, colo. (outside denver), loudoun, va. (outside washington, d.c.), and wake, n.c. (home to raleigh). 3. four years ago, 38 precincts in detroit cast zero votes for the republican presidential ticket. trump has pointed to big-city returns like those to argue the elections are ""rigged."" but the pattern is easily explained by a familiar feature of presidential politics: african-american support for democrats is one-sided in the extreme. president obama won 93% of the black vote, according to 2012 exit polls. he won 100% in some precincts in milwaukee, philadelphia, chicago and other cities. he won 98% of the vote in wayne county's biggest city, detroit. in a recent detroit free press/wxyz-tv poll, no black voters in the survey backed trump. the republican has tried to woo african-american voters, even taking his pitch to a detroit church this fall. but it's clear here and elsewhere that his message has been undercut by his own rhetoric, including his claims of urban voting fraud and his bleak portrayal of black communities as violent and despairing. clinton doesn't generate the enthusiasm obama did with this demographic. in the president's re-election, black turnout surpassed white turnout, according to census surveys. election night clue: whether clinton gets fewer votes than obama in counties with sizable black populations such as philadelphia, milwaukee and cuyahoga, ohio (cleveland). 4. arizona was not expected to be a tossup state in 2016, having voted republican for president in every election but one since the 1960s. but right now it's more competitive than some perennial swing states, inviting a late clinton ad blitz. one big reason: a latino backlash against trump's hard line on immigration and his comments about mexican americans. something similar has happened in texas, where the republican margin is far slimmer than in previous races. polls give clinton a more than 2-to-1 lead among latinos in arizona. once again, turnout is the x factor. four years ago, latinos made up 30% of the population in massive maricopa county (home to phoenix) but only an estimated 15% of the votes cast. latinos have lower rates of citizenship and lower rates of voting, diluting their political clout. maricopa county hasn't voted democratic in more than 60 years. if that streak ends this year, it could alter the presidential map. election night clue: whether latinos match the share of the total vote they represented in the 2012 national exit poll (10%) and in  states like florida (17%), nevada (19%) and arizona (18%). 5. iowa has been one of trump's best and clinton's shakiest battlegrounds, despite having twice voted for obama. a key factor is clinton's weakness and trump's strength with rural voters, who made up more than half the vote in iowa in 2012, far higher than in any other swing state. democrats need to be competitive with rural whites to win battlegrounds like iowa, wisconsin and new hampshire. the divide between urban and rural voters has been a growing feature of american politics. obama won urban voters by 26points and lost rural voters by 20, according to the 2012 exit poll -- a gap of 46 points. that gap could grow larger this year. election night clue: whether trump exceeds mitt romney's 2012 share of the rural vote in wisconsin (53%), iowa (52%) and ohio (60%). 6. young voters have no perceived champion in this race: obama is off the ballot and  bernie sanders lost the democratic nomination. clinton has struggled to mobilize  them. colorado is the youngest state (demographically) of the battlegrounds. and very purple larimer county, home to colorado state, is among its younger counties. young voters  have been slow to embrace either nominee, raising questions about how many will stay home or vote for a minor-party candidate. election night clue: whether the under-30 vote matches its share of the national vote in 2012 (19%) and whether clinton wins those voters by a margin similar to obama's (23points). 7. of the five battleground states where blue-collar whites are a majority of the electorate, ohio is easily the most important in deciding the next president (the others are wisconsin, michigan, iowa and new hampshire). when we visited clark county, home of springfield, we found a community striving to bounce back from years of harsh industrial decline.  trump's stands on trade and immigration appeal to some, while his volatility turns off others. clark county was decided by 523 votes in 2012 and is expected to be closely divided in this election. election night clue: just how big the divide is between college and non-college voters (in 2012, there was virtually no difference in the way the two groups voted). 8. there is no path to victory for trump without florida's 29 electoral votes. hillsborough county is a microcosm of the nation: urban, suburban, rural; 51% white, 27% hispanic and 18% black. and it has picked the winner in 19 of the past 20 presidential elections. obama won 35 of the 50 most populous metros in 2012 -- by a staggering margin of almost 12million votes.  but metropolitan tampa bay mirrored the national vote more closely than almost any other large metro four years ago. it is arguably america's top battleground-state battleground",NEWS;

" my 401(k)  is the largest investment i own. and i'm convinced that part of the reason for the wealth gap in this country is the availability of 401(k)-style retirement plans for the ""have"" segment but not the ""have-nots."" so when yet another survey touting the benefits of 401(k)s came out this month, i initially gave it little thought. this one, from wells fargo, like many before it, underscored the positive impact  401(k)s can have. of the 1,200-plus people interviewed, those with a 401(k)-type plan reported $87,000 in median savings, compared with $10,000 for those lacking access. ""the most glaring difference to me lies in how much people with access have saved for retirement, comparatively,"" said joe ready, head of wells fargo institutional retirement & trust. all of which leads to the natural conclusion that having access to a workplace retirement plan is the key to financial success. but that's not necessarily the case. anyone with a regular paycheck actually could fare at least as well, and possibly better, investing outside a 401(k) plan ... assuming they mimic the ongoing saving habits of 401(k) investors. don't think so? consider how these common benefits of 401(k)s really shake out: tax deduction/ deferral when most people invest in a 401(k), the money goes in on a pretax basis and grows tax-sheltered until withdrawn. this is a nice tax break. nevertheless, when the money comes out, it will be taxed as ordinary income. if you instead invest outside of a 401(k) in a low-cost, tax-efficient index mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, your earnings would be mostly or entirely tax-deferred until withdrawn, when possibly  lower capital-gains rates would apply. tax penalties in general, withdrawals from 401(k)s made prior to age 591/2 trigger a 10% tax penalty, along with the regular tax bite.  no penalty applies on non-retirement accounts. withdrawal times eventually, money in a traditional 401(k) plan will need to come out and taxes paid. these withdrawals can gunk up the rest of your finances. in particular, if you start making large 401(k) withdrawals while drawing monthly social security benefits, the former could be high enough to make some of the latter taxable. if you instead use a non-401(k) investment, you have greater flexibility in deciding whether, and when, to make withdrawals. investment selection some 401(k)s offer a wide lineup of investments, but they won't exceed what you can find on your own. on average, 401(k) plans offer 19 mutual funds or other choices, according to the plan sponsor council of america. meanwhile, those outside 401(k)s have thousands of choices. employer matching funds this is the one unequivocal advantage of 401(k) plans. many companies offer up to several thousand dollars a year to encourage workers to participate. the most common match cited is 50 cents on the dollar, for the first 6% of pay. it's free money. matching funds are nice, but they usually represent only a modest slice of an account's balance. so what's the most valuable benefit of 401(k)s? i think it's the ability to have money regularly deducted from each paycheck and invested automatically. the wells fargo report touched on this. ""the power of automated, systematic saving and investing for retirement through payroll deductions works,"" ready said. but this is not a feature unique to 401(k)s -- hundreds of mutual-fund groups and other investment companies will gladly set you up with automatic investing from each paycheck or your checking account. so if you don't have 401(k) coverage at work, all is not lost",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,You might be able to beat a 401(k) by going it alone; Access to workplace retirement plan nice but not only choice,11/3/16

" police said it appeared both officers were taken by surprise in the wednesday shootings and had no opportunity to defend themselves. one of the killings took place near the stadium where the mid-october confrontation took place between police and the 46-year-old suspect, identified as scott michael greene. both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars. in the initial shooting, urbandale police chief ross mccarty said it appears that greene fired 15 to 30 shots into the driver's side of a patrol car, killing urbandale police officer justin martin. ""the puzzling thing about this is that (officer martin) didn't have any idea or warning or fear that anything was wrong,"" mccarty said. martin, 24, appeared to be stopped in his vehicle. ""we're assuming (greene) walked up on foot."" about 20 minutes later, a second officer, des moines police sgt. anthony ""tony"" beminio, 38, was shot and killed about 2 miles away while responding to the first shooting. the suspect was captured  about eight hours after the shootings about 35 miles west of the crime scenes. he was taken into custody by the dallas county sheriff's department while walking along a rural road in redfield. according to police, greene flagged down a passing department of natural resources officer, handed over his id and told the officer to call police. no shots were fired, and there was no struggle. greene was taken by ambulance to a des moines hospital after complaining about a medicine-related issue. court records indicate greene had previous encounters with urbandale police officers. in the oct. 14 confrontation, greene was removed from urbandale high school's football stadium after he claimed other spectators stole his confederate flag, authorities said. he apparently posted two videos related to the incident on youtube. in one, greene, who is white, says he was in the stands, holding a confederate flag during the national anthem, and that several ""african-american"" people behind him stole it. throughout the video, he tells officers he wants to report an assault and a theft. officers tell him that people said he was a disturbance. ""it was almost like a mugging. i had my property, and i was holding it and they stole it from me,"" he says in the video. greene also is seen confronting officers, questioning why he was being asked to leave the school's property. officers tell him that holding a confederate flag violates a school district code. a different 10-second video by greene, uploaded oct. 21, shows an image of himself with confederate and u.s. flags. the fatal shootings wednesday began around 1:06 a.m., when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire. ""it doesn't look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars,"" des moines police spokesman sgt. paul parizek said in an emotional briefing with reporters. ""in all appearances it looks ... that these officers were ambushed,"" he added. in washington, u.s. attorney general loretta lynch condemned the killings, saying ""violence has no place in the united states of america.'' ""let me be clear, there is no message in murder,'' the attorney general said, referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country. ""violence creates nothing; it only destroys.'' within hours, police identified greene as a suspect, releasing his photographs along with information about the truck he was believed to be driving. officials, however, were tight-lipped on how they singled him out early on as the suspect. greene had earlier run-ins with police before the stadium incident. in april 2014, according to court records, he was charged with a simple misdemeanor count of interference with official acts for resisting an attempt by officers to pat him down for weapons at an urbandale residence. the officers wanted to search greene after noticing he had a pouch on his belt that resembled a holster. greene was ""noncompliant, hostile, combative and made furtive movements toward his pockets"" before the arrest, officer chris greenfield wrote in the complaint. greene pleaded guilty to the charge about two weeks later. the complaint does not indicate why officers initially came into contact with greene. but two days later he reportedly threatened to kill a man in the parking lot of the same apartment complex and was charged with first-degree harassment, according to another complaint. in that incident, greene was accused of approaching a man in the parking lot and shining a flashlight in his eyes. greene, who lived in the apartments, called the man the n-word and told the man ""i will kill you, (expletive) kill you,"" according to the complaint. greene pleaded guilty to a lesser harassment charge on june30, 2014, and was sentenced to one year probation. in a discharge report filed in june 2015, a probation officer wrote greene received a mental health evaluation and ""reports to have complied with the medication recommendations."" wednesday's fatal shootings marked the first time a des moines officer has been shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977. two des moines officers, susan farrell and carlos puente-morales, died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunken driver. the killing of the urbandale officer appeared to be the city's first for an officer shot in the line of duty, officials said. parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost farrell and puente-morales, as well as with the latest tragedy. ""i don't even know where to begin on how bad this year is,"" he said. but, ""this is what we do. we come in day in and day out, we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what's going on in our personal and professional lives."" in a statement, iowa gov. terry branstad called the attack on the officers ""an attack on the public safety of all iowans.""

" the final rule, announced wednesday by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, is designed to speed medicare coverage of a program to combat a disease suffered by  a quarter of people 65 and older. national trade associations representing hospitals and doctors enthusiastically supported cms' plan in comments filed with the agency. the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america (phrma) trade group, however, said in its comments that cms is setting a ""flawed precedent"" and acting upon only ""preliminary"" evidence. a federal contractor studied the program for at least two years and the national institutes of health (nih) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) analyzed it for about 20 years before that. in 2002, an independent safety board advising nih said it would be unethical to withhold such an effective treatment from the placebo group in a study of 3,000 patients. when it comes to diabetes, time is money. those on medicare with diabetes cost the federal government nearly twice that of people who do not have the disease -- or nearly $16,000 a year. the diabetes prevention program, now offered at about 1,000 ymcas around the country, helped people at high risk of developing diabetes lose about 5% of their body weight -- enough to substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes. the program combines nutrition, fitness and lifestyle education over a four-month period. cms hopes to expand the program, which starts january 2018, to more ys and other groups certified by the cdc. ""i thought it was going to be one of the biggest home runs we were going to hit,"" says cms acting administrator andy slavitt. ""who could possibly be against preventing disease except for people who maybe manufacture drugs to fight disease?"" phrma spokeswoman allyson funk insists her group ""supports diabetes prevention efforts and the diabetes prevention program."" drugmakers have problems with how cms is expanding the program, she says. pnrma's comments, however, challenged several aspects of cms' proposal, including that it would reduce spending and improve health care. the program's expansion is being done on a sort of fast-track basis through cms's innovation center, which was funded through the affordable care act. the diabetes program is the first ""demonstration project"" to be approved for medicare coverage. the traditional path to medicare coverage would be a ""several year process,"" says robert ratner, a physician who was a contract investigator for nih who began working on the diabetes program in the 1990s. ""all they (phrma) want to do is increase the bureaucratic process of getting this approved,"" says ratner, now chief scientific and medical officer at the american diabetes association. when data show a test like this improves the quality of health care, ""we have the authority to expand to entire medicare population,"" says patrick conway, a physician who heads innovation and quality at cms. ""if the innovation center did not exist and we couldn't have done this test, this program may have never been available."" when compared with similar people not in the diabetes program, cms said the estimated savings of $2,650 for each person enrolled in the diabetes prevention program over a 15-month period was more than enough to cover the cost of the program. about 30 million people in the united states now have type 2 diabetes, which leads to an average of two deaths every five minutes. another 86 million are at high risk of developing diabetes, because one in every three adults have higher than normal blood glucose levels, known as prediabetes. along with type 2 diabetes, people with pre-diabetes are at increased risk for developing heart disease and stroke. many people with pre-diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. conversely, the american medical association noted that it was an early supporter of the diabetes program and partnered with the national y to encourage doctors to refer patients to the program. that partnership was the basis for the certification by cms' actuary that was cited in the proposed rule. the american hospital association also supported making the medicare funding of the program permanent. ezekiel emanuel, an oncologist who was health policy adviser at the white house, says the diabetes program ""is exactly the kind of prevention program we should all want tested and expanded."" is the data perfect? no",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"Federal officials approve YMCA's diabetes program; Drugmakers warn of 'flawed precedent,' preliminary data",11/3/16

" california for decades has been home to a thriving illegal marketplace for black-market cannabis, but a legalization vote tuesday could dramatically alter the landscape. a state-taxed marijuana marketplace in california could generate $1 billion in taxes, experts say. that's money that today vanishes into the pockets of black marketers and smugglers. polls show the measure with significant public support. ""i really believe california really is a watershed moment for this industry,"" said adam bierman, co-founder of the national cannabis firm medmen. the company offers consulting and management services to the marijuana industry, and bierman oversees the medmen opportunity fund, a $100 million private equity fund focused on cannabis ventures. nationally, legal pot initiatives could spell a three-fold expansion in legal cannabis in the u.s. the marijuana industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 29% over the next four years, said giada decarcer, founder and ceo of cannabis-focused analysis firm new frontier data. despite this outlook, the amount of venture capital investment in marijuana remains low compared to industries that traditionally receive this kind of growth financing. the second quarter of 2015 was the biggest ever. even then, only about $150million in capital was invested in marijuana-linked companies, according to pitchbook data. a year later, investments for the same quarter sank to $54million, the financial analysis firm said. about $776 million in capital has been invested into the industry since the start of 2016, according to viridian capital advisors. in comparison, overall venture capital investment hit nearly $20billion in the second quarter of 2015, rising to $22.1 billion in q2 of this year. legal pot's slight investment draw was dwarfed by more traditional industries, such as software. but the potential is obvious: a new study by colorado economists found that marijuana legalization created 18,005 new jobs in 2015 and netted $996 million in sales and $121 million in taxes, with an overall $2.4 billion economic impact for colorado alone. numbers like these have piqued interest. ""we are already seeing an enormous amount of interest from investors and entrepreneurs who recognize the unique scale of the opportunity presented by cannabis legalization,"" said troy dayton, the arcview group's ceo. oakland-based arcview is an investment network that has made $84million in marijuana-related investments since 2013. in many cases, the chartering language of large institutional and venture capital firms prohibits them from directly participating in anything illegal or immoral. there's a ban on transport across state lines. regardless of how california votes next month, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level -- a fact that translates into ""reputational risk"" for investors. additionally, it's virtually impossible for people operating in the marijuana space to get bank accounts. in colorado, washington, oregon and alaska, marijuana-store owners are forced to conduct their transactions in cash, including paying their taxes. ""banks aren't going to touch this unless there is clear guidance from the feds that they aren't going to prosecute, and they want it in writing, which is something the federal government has not been willing to do yet,"" said john kagia, new frontier's executive vice president of industry analytics. ""so as a result, you end up with a $7.5 billion industry that is still largely being done in cash. it's not sustainable. it leads to enormous security concerns ... and operational inefficiencies."" there's at least a partial answer to these legal gray areas: real estate. investors reluctant to ""touch"" marijuana directly are rapidly expanding their property portfolios. earlier this month, a san diego-based real estate investment trust announced plans to raise $175 million with an ipo that would fund the purchase of marijuana grow facilities across the country. california voters are widely expected to endorse legalization, which will help persuade more large-scale investors to dip their toes into the marketplace.

""it was just a perfect storm of capitalizing on trends and doing stuff a little bit differently than other people have,"" says lucas sachs, content and social media manager at dance music publication youredm.com. ""it's a really catchy melody, it's not too complex, but at the same time, it's something new that people really haven't heard before."" plus, the combination of their young fanbase and radio airplay means ""everyone's hearing it, whether they're high-school age or 50-plus. the fact that they can hit that dynamic range of ages is why it's maintained that success."" the chainsmokers also have been savvy in crafting their image and building excitement among fans. rather than cobble together a debut album, they've intermittently released new singles online, which ""keeps the focus on the songs"" and translates to more sales and streams, aswad says. and choosing not to work with superstar artists has so far ""prevented them from being overshadowed. they and halsey are both on the rise, so they sort of fed off each other."" they don't appear to be slowing down, either. their latest single, all we know with phoebe ryan, peaked at no. 18 on the hot 100 late last month. and while they have caught some flak from music fans for their braggadocious interviews and alleged rip-offs of other artists, their imprint on 2016 is undeniable.

""dodgers fans were denied a fair competitive process when directv orchestrated a series of information exchanges with direct competitors that ultimately made consumers less likely to be able to watch their hometown team,"" deputy assistant attorney general jonathan sallet of the doj's antitrust division said in a statement. ""competition, not collusion, best serves consumers and that is especially true when, as with pay-television providers, consumers have only a handful of choices in the marketplace."" stan kasten, president and ceo of the dodgers, called the allegations ""shocking but not surprising"" in a statement posted to twitter. time warner cable, acquired in 2015 by charter, paid the dodgers $8.35 billion in 2013 for the rights to games for 25 years. when sportsnet la launched in 2014, many satellite and cable providers balked at what they considered high fees to carry the channel. the sharing of information ""made it less likely that any of these companies would reach a deal"" because each knew the competition was unlikely to begin carrying the channel, the complaint says. should directv, especially, decide to carry sportsnet la, the other companies would feel forced to, to prevent subscriber defections, the suit says. but at&t general counsel david mcatee said the company sees ""the fact differently,"" he said in a statement released after the doj complaint was announced. ""the reason why no other major tv provider chose to carry this content was that no one wanted to force all of their customers to pay the inflated prices that time warner cable was demanding for a channel devoted solely to la dodgers baseball. we make our carriage decisions independently, legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner. we look forward to presenting these facts in court."" the case complicates issues for at&t, which two weeks ago announced its $85.4 billion bid for time warner. (time warner includes cnn, warner bros. studio and hbo; it spun off time warner cable in 2009.) since that deal will require doj approval, at&t will likely settle this suit, says phil swann, president of tvpredictions.com.

""smelling a rat,"" in the words of the judge in the case, he created a new airbnb profile using a photo of a white man. the host accepted the booking that had been denied when selden's profile showed him as a black man. selden launched a suit alleging racial discrimination against airbnb on may 17. tuesday, the court ruled that he could not sue airbnb because the site's terms of service clearly state that users are bound to accept arbitration and cannot bring suit against the company. selden's suit argued the sign-up procedure did not give him adequate notice he was agreeing to airbnb's terms of service and so no contract was created when he clicked the box. even if a contract had been formed, he argued that the arbitration provision did not apply to discrimination suits and was ""unconscionable in any event."" judge christopher cooper of the united states district court for the district of columbia disagreed. in his ruling he wrote, ""no matter one's opinion of the widespread and controversial practice of requiring consumers to relinquish their fundamental right to a jury trial -- and forgo class actions -- as a condition of simply participating in today's digital economy, the applicable law is clear."" ""this court is not the proper forum for policy objections to mandatory arbitration clauses,"" he wrote. selden was ""disappointed"" in the ruling and plans to immediately appeal the case to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, his attorney ikechukwu emejuru said in a statement. airbnb has been dogged with complaints of discrimination, which crystallized around the hashtag #airbnbwhileblack this spring. a flurry of reports on similar situations caused the san francisco-based company to revamp its terms of service this fall. a newly rewritten non-discrimination policy specifically states that airbnb hosts may not decline a guest based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status. hosts will be reminded of the non-discrimination policy during the hosting and booking process, the company said. beginning next year, hosts' reservation calendars will also immediately be blocked for dates they have told a would-be guest are not available. this is to deal with a problem selden and others have complained of, where after requesting a booking they're told the listing is no longer available, only to find the booking is still available when someone with a profile photo that shows them to be white or obscures their race, inquires about it.

" the wisconsin democrat is trying to take back the senate seat he held for 18 years from republican sen. ron johnson, who beat feingold by 5 percentage points in 2010. feingold has been leading in most polls, but the race is tightening and political action committees from both sides are pouring millions of dollars into the state in the final days leading up to tuesday's election. the wisconsin race and the contest in neighboring illinois are considered democrats' best chances to beat incumbent republican senators, according to the non-partisan cook political report and the rothenberg & gonzales political report. ""wisconsin reflects what's going on nationally in a lot of ways,"" said barry burden, a political science professor and director of the elections research center at the university of wisconsin-madison. ""it's a swing state where republicans swept in in the 2010 tea party wave and are now facing real difficulty in a presidential election year. johnson and other republican senators are having to play defense and navigate around donald trump and his controversies."" six other senate races -- in nevada, missouri, indiana, pennsylvania, north carolina and new hampshire -- are virtual ties heading into election day, and only nevada is a seat currently held by a democrat. democrats need a net gain of five seats to win the majority, or four seats to split the senate 50-50. the wisconsin race is the only competitive contest that is a rematch. in the last 100 years, only one defeated senator beat the man who had beaten him to win back his seat, the senate historical office's data shows. democratic sen. peter gerry of rhode island lost to republican felix hebert in 1928 but defeated hebert in a rematch in 1934. feingold is well-positioned to become the second rematch winner, burden said. ""i think feingold has the advantage because hillary clinton is still likely to win the state, no republican has won the senate race in wisconsin in a presidential year since 1980, and he's slightly better known and slightly better liked than johnson,"" he said. a monmouth university poll released oct. 19 showed feingold with an 8-point lead over johnson, and a marquette university poll released wednesday showed just a 1-point lead for feingold. a compilation of recent polls by realclearpolitics shows feingold leading by an average of about 5 points. ""the race has narrowed, but feingold remains well-placed to return to the senate barring any major shakeup,"" said patrick murray, director of the non-partisan monmouth university polling institute. however, republicans still believe they can save johnson, and the billionaire koch brothers and other conservatives are pumping millions into the race to buy ads attacking feingold for his past support of obamacare. feingold's supporters, including a group called end citizens united,  are countering that effort by paying for ads attacking johnson for voting to protect $21 billion in tax cuts for the world's biggest oil companies. here's a quick look at the seven other most competitive senate races: illinois democratic rep. tammy duckworth is up an average of 13 percentage points over republican sen. mark kirk, according to a compilation of recent polls by realclearpolitics. kirk, a moderate republican in a democratic-leaning state, is considered by many analysts to be the most vulnerable senator in this year's election. kirk recently lost the support of the human rights campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, and the gun control group americans for responsible solutions after he questioned how duckworth's ancestors could possibly have fought in the revolutionary war since she was born in thailand. the congresswoman's father was a u.s. marine who fought in vietnam and can trace his family back to america's fight for independence from england. nevada the race to fill the open seat vacated by retiring democratic leader harry reid stands at a virtual tie between republican rep. joe heck and democrat catherine cortez masto, the state's former attorney general. the tossup race represents the one state that democrats are in danger of losing to republicans, which would make it more difficult for the party to capture the majority in the senate. indiana after leading in earlier polls, democratic former senator evan bayh is now tied with republican rep. todd young in the latest monmouth university poll. the two men are battling for the open seat of retiring republican sen. dan coats. republicans have succeeded in eroding bayh's popularity by accusing him of having moved to washington to make money as a lobbyist after he left the senate. missouri republican sen. roy blunt and democratic secretary of state jason kander are in a virtual tie in a monmouth poll released tuesday, which showed blunt with a statistically meaningless 1-point lead. the senator had led kander by 5 points in august. democrats have attacked blunt for spending more time at his house in washington than he does in missouri and for the fact that his wife and three of his children are washington lobbyists. pennsylvania democrat katie mcginty had a slight lead of 3 percentage points over republican sen. pat toomey in the latest monmouth university poll released wednesday. the two candidates were tied last month. mcginty has been a strong supporter of clinton. toomey has tried to distance himself from trump, but has not said whether he will vote for him. new hampshire the race between two powerful women -- republican sen. kelly ayotte and democratic gov. maggie hassan -- remains a virtual tie. ayotte leads in recent polls by an average of not quite 2 percentage points, according to realclearpolitics. north carolina republican sen. richard burr's slim lead over democratic challenger deborah ross has slipped since early fall, according to polls compiled by realclearpolitics. burr had an average lead of nearly 4 percentage points on sept. 2 , but that had fallen to less than 2 points as of nov. 2",NEWS; Pg. 8A,USA TODAY,8 races will determine control of Senate; Wisconsin rematch could be one of 5 Democrats need,11/4/16

""i know he's a good businessman, but as president of the united states, it's scary."" republican barbara comstock's costly re-election fight here is a test of the ""trump effect"" -- whether the gop nominee drags some of his party's congressional candidates down to defeat. some democratic gains are widely expected. but because there are so few competitive house seats in america today -- and because democrats need a whopping 30-seat gain to take over -- hardly anyone expects control of the house to change hands. ""democrats need to win almost every competitive seat in order to win the majority,"" says nathan gonzales, who tracks house races for the non-partisan rothenberg & gonzales political report. after suffering through trump's post-convention struggles, house republicans are now taking heart in a tightening presidential race, along with the revival of the clinton email controversy as the fbi examines new evidence in that case. it's unclear what impact that story will have on election day, but it's a reminder that the top of the ticket poses political problems for some democratic candidates, too. ""she's almost as unpopular as mr. trump is in these competitive districts,"" says gop rep. greg walden of oregon, chairman of the national republican congressional committee.

""it's a big leap,"" said democratic pollster celinda lake. local factors will shape the outcome race by race, but two broader sets of forces are at work. one is an obstacle for the gop: a presidential race in which their candidate is not only trailing, but has turned off many independents and some republicans -- especially in suburban districts with lots of college-educated voters. when it comes to dealing with trump, walden has advised his gop colleagues to ""do what's right for your districts,"" meaning dozens of republicans have distanced themselves from the nominee or flat out said they won't vote for him. the other is an obstacle for democrats: an overwhelming number of house seats these days are one-sided in their partisan makeup, meaning they are virtually unwinnable for the other party. the playing field isn't just narrow, it's also tilted. the majority of house districts lean republican, even in bad years for the gop. that's due to a combination of gop gerrymandering (the way the districts are drawn) and the geography of where the two parties' voters live (democrats are more concentrated in urban areas, so their voters are packed into fewer districts). ""it still remarkable in this volatile environment we aren't talking about a single competitive race in ohio,"" said gonzales. but while the gop's house majority is almost bulletproof, the more seats the party loses next week, the harder it may be for speaker paul ryan of wisconsin to manage rebellious conservative in his caucus or fend off post-election challenges to his leadership. ryan has been crisscrossing the country for republicans in tough races and has plowed more than $35 million this year into the house gop's national campaign committee. among the gop lawmakers locked in tight races are california's darrell issa, florida's john mica, new hampshire's frank guinta and new jersey's scott garrett. mica has been in office since the early 1990s, but his seat became more democratic after a court-ordered redistricting. issa's southern california race will be another test of the trump effect in an increasingly purple district (with a growing latino population). guinta is facing a unique rematch with democrat carol shea-porter, who he has both beaten and lost to in prior years. it is the fourth time the two have run against each other and democrats tend to do better in the district in presidential years. garrett is facing an opponent who has raised $4 million, a new high for any new jersey house candidate, and the seven-term incumbent's hard-line conservative views have increasingly become a liability in the race. the northern virginia race between comstock and democrat luann bennett is one of the most expensive the country. a barrage of democratic ads has pilloried comstock for waiting too long to repudiate trump",NEWS; Pg. 8A,USA TODAY,Republicans hope to avoid anti-Trump wave in the House; Dems expected to make some gains but not likely enough to take control from GOP,11/4/16
" the one between trump and barack obama. in many ways, trump's unorthodox, aggressive presidential campaign is driven by antipathy toward obama. the president, in turn, has campaigned harder than any president not running for re-election in his  aggressive bid to stop trump from winning the opportunity to dismantle his legacy. after obama deemed trump ""unfit"" for the presidency during an august news conference, trump retorted on twitter that obama ""will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the united states!"" and so it seemed only fitting that, with just five days left until election day, their paths would cross in the pivotal state of florida. trump's plane and air force one were both parked at the miami airport wednesday and thursday, and obama's miami hotel overlooked the venue where trump spoke on wednesday. even trump took note of the fact that obama seemed to be shadowing him. ""looking at air force one"" in miami, he tweeted thursday. ""why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs & fixing obamacare? get back to work for the american people!"" trump also criticized obama over his campaign efforts at a later rally in jacksonville. ""this guy ought to be back in the office working,"" trump said of obama, who also held a campaign event thursday in jacksonville. ""he's not going to be there very long, thank goodness."" michael caputo, a former trump campaign aide, said that while the new york businessman is more motivated these days by defeating the democratic nominee, his initial inspiration was to ""try to undo the damage"" wrought by the obama administration. ""obama is as much a motivation for his candidacy as hillary clinton,"" he said. in rally after rally, trump has pledged to ""repeal"" obama's landmark health care law; to strike down a litany of obama executive orders, particularly on immigration and energy production; and to kill the nuclear deal with iran and the new diplomatic approach to cuba. trump has accused the president of being ""the founder"" of the islamic state. seeking to link the president to the current democratic nominee, trump has vowed to end ""the obama-clinton war on coal"" and the ""obama-clinton defense sequester."" in miami this week, as he has elsewhere, trump told supporters that ""the last thing we need is another four years of obama."" for his part, obama is playing the traditional role of the high-profile campaign surrogate by going on the attack. during a miami speech thursday, the president blasted trump's populist credentials. ""this is a guy who spent 70 years, his whole life, born with a silver spoon, showing no respect for working people,"" obama said, adding that trump had only surrounded himself with ""working people"" when they were ""cleaning his room."" in north carolina on wednesday, obama called trump a ""con artist and a know-nothing"" and said he was ""temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief."" the rivalry extends back to the years in which trump pondered a challenge to the president's 2012 re-election bid. the real estate mogul and reality television star built a name in politics by becoming the de facto leader of the movement known as ""birtherism,"" the false idea that obama was not born in the united states. the flap prompted obama to produce a  birth certificate from hawaii. the president also got back at trump in a most public way, with pointed jabs during the 2011  white house correspondents association dinner. as trump sat in the audience, obama riffed that nobody was happier than ""the donald"" to have the birth certificate issue resolved so that ""he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter -- like, did we fake the moon landing? what really happened in roswell? and where are biggie and tupac?"" within weeks, trump announced he would not run for president in 2012. the idea obviously stuck with him, however, though trump has denied that the rhetorical beating he took at that  dinner was the impetus for his 2016 presidential bid. two-term presidents are often issues in the races to replace them. obama himself attacked outgoing president george w. bush during his initial bid in 2008, and bush made president bill clinton one of the issues in the 2000 race.

""this is the greatest moment in chicago sports history,"" bill dodds, 51, a life-long cubs fan, said as he stood in a long line outside a t-shirt shop across from the ballpark to buy world series gear.

""i dropped to my knees and wept into my w flag,"" aviles said. fans also marked the cubs' victory by leaving green apples at the grave site of the team's famed broadcaster, harry caray, who died in 1998. during a 1991 broadcast, caray famously assured fans, ""sure as god made green apples, someday the chicago cubs are going to be in the world series."" devoted fans have lived through decades of anguish and bad luck -- the 1945 world series collapse tied to the famed billy goat curse; the september collapse by the 1969 cubs; a ball dribbling under leon durham's gatorade-soaked glove in the decisive game of the 1984 national league championship series, and the infamous steve bartman game in the 2003 nlcs. they are now ready to give up the lovable loser moniker that chaffed at the team's serious, albeit tortured, fan base. cubs fans are entering territory -- a reasonable hope to compete for world series titles for years to come -- that the north side faithful haven't traversed for the better part of the last century. ginger peak, a longtime season ticketholder who attended the clincher in cleveland, said the reality of her beloved cubs finally winning the world series still felt a bit dreamlike.

""people are so freaked out about the stakes in this election that they are doing whatever they can to make sure that their vote counts,"" said doug chapin, an elections expert at the university of minnesota. early voters interviewed thursday by the usa today network from north carolina to california indicated a similar desire to lock in their choices now, having seen and heard enough from the candidates, commentators and commercials. they also were eager to avoid long lines -- and potential chaos -- at the polls on tuesday. there were clinton voters convinced the former first lady, senator and secretary of state is most qualified for the presidency. and in many cases, they were eager to make history by electing the first woman president. ""i did get a little choked up, i have to say,"" cathi dupuy of columbus, ohio, said after voting for clinton. ""that felt amazing to me."" there were trump voters assured the new york developer would best manage the economy and reduce the federal budget deficit -- including some who worried the election, as trump claims, could be rigged.

""it's just a time-constraint thing,"" said joe kiger, an 18-year-old student at de pere high school who cast his first presidential vote for trump. ""i figured next tuesday would be really busy, especially since i have limited time after school because i have clubs and stuff."" various tallies kept by elections experts show early voting could surpass 2012 in popularity by  election day. the percentage of voters who cast ballots early rose from 30% in 2008 to 32% four years ago. that represented about 46 million mail and in-person early votes. this year, michael mcdonald, an associate professor of political science at the university of florida who keeps the most up-to-date statistics, expects as many as 35% of the votes to be cast early -- possibly approaching 50 million. ""they have made up their minds,"" mcdonald said. ""they feel comfortable about casting their votes."" just in case they don't, president obama added his voice to the effort during one of his many college campus events for clinton thursday. the president urged 4,500 mostly young people at florida international university in miami to vote early, as a large banner hanging over the crowd recommended.

" the government said it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling and will appeal to the supreme court. a further hearing on the ruling is expected next month. a majority of british voters backed an exit from the eu, known as brexit, in a june 23 referendum. may, who became prime minister after the brexit vote, argued she has the authority to invoke article 50 of the lisbon treaty, the formal legislation that would start the withdrawal. the court ruling came from a lawsuit -- brought by british businesswoman and philanthropist gina miller, plumber charlie mullins and hairdresser deir dos santos -- challenging may's right to trigger the process of leaving the 28-nation eu without parliamentary approval. ""if you ever wanted to know how to pour gasoline on a populist fire, then this is a great example,"" matthew goodwin, a politics professor at the university of kent, said about the ruling. ""to many (brexit supporters) this will look like nothing short of a great betrayal, an attempt to undermine the sovereignty of the people,"" he said. ""members of parliament might get a vote, (but) it would be political suicide for them to ignore the wishes of their constituents."" thursday's ruling is unlikely to derail brexit, and may had already vowed to confer with lawmakers on any new agreement with the eu, but it adds more uncertainty to the complex situation, especially since no other country has left the eu. may has pledged to trigger article 50 by the end of march, a move that would give the u.k. and eu two years to negotiate details of britain's status outside the alliance. such issues would include whether the u.k. retains its tariff-free trade with eu nations or accepts current rules on migration for eu nationals. may argued that the historic power of royal prerogative gives her authority to launch the brexit process. a royal prerogative allows the prime minister to make decisions without consulting parliament and has been used to adopt international treaties, deploy troops and call for elections. one possible fallout from the ruling, if upheld by the supreme court, is it raises the prospect of an early election, currently scheduled for may 2020, said camilla hagelund, an expert on europe at the risk analysis firm verisk maplecroft. even if that happens, she said may's ruling conservative party would likely increase its  majority over the opposition labour party. labour leader jeremy corbyn said he respected ""the decision of the british people to leave"" the eu, but he favored allowing lawmakers a say in negotiations. following thursday's ruling, the british pound surged against the dollar, euro and other major currencies. the pound has lost about 20% of its value against the dollar since the vote amid concerns about what it will mean for the u.k.'s economy. minutes after the court decision, the pound leaped more than 1% vs. the dollar, and was up against the euro. u.k. independence party leader nigel farage, one of the architects and primary defenders of brexit, said, ""i now fear that every attempt will be made to block or delay the triggering of article 50. if this is so, they have no idea of the level of public anger they will provoke",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,Court rules Parliament must vote on Brexit; Prime minister still vows to act using royal prerogative,11/4/16
""" speaking thursday in north carolina, a critical battleground where early voting figures suggest black turnout is thus far lower than it was in barack obama's re-election campaign in 2012, clinton mentioned trump's recent endorsement by the ku klux klan's official newspaper -- which the trump campaign has rejected -- and focused on the real estate mogul's history, including a 1970s justice department housing discrimination lawsuit involving one of his apartment buildings. the democratic nominee also mentioned the central park five, a group of black and latino teenagers arrested and charged with brutally attacking and raping a white female jogger in 1989. dna evidence later exonerated them, but trump has maintained his belief that they are guilty. ""not only did donald trump refuse to apologize,"" said clinton, ""he actually said they should still be in prison."" ""do any of us have a place in trump's america?"" she asked the crowd at pitt community college, as speakers before her warned of voter suppression efforts in the state, including registration cancellations, that prompted an naacp lawsuit. as the democratic nominee looks to boost turnout among african americans, she is also looking to move past a surprise announcement last week that the fbi is reviewing new emails that may involve her private server. however, compared to a week ago, her advantage in polls nationally and in key states is narrowing, and trump is using the email development to slam clinton in every campaign speech, as she seeks to change the subject. during a late-night rally tuesday in fort lauderdale, the former secretary of state urged supporters not to ""get distracted"" as she sought to turn the spotlight back to issues that could be damaging to trump. her communications director, jennifer palmieri, said clinton will not be mentioning the email issue further in her speeches. instead, she is hammering trump. on wednesday in las vegas, clinton asked supporters at a local pipe fitters union hall to ""imagine with me what it would be like to have donald trump sitting in the oval office come next january."" she cited trump's comments that more countries should have nuclear weapons and that the military is ""a disaster."" trump would violate constitutional religious freedom protections and set a bad example with his rhetoric for little girls and boys, she said. trump's refusal at their final debate last month to commit to accepting the results of the election amounts to an attack democracy itself, she added. ""this has never happened in american history,"" said clinton. ""this, my friends, is not a normal election."" the emails that sparked the fbi announcement were found on the laptop of disgraced former congressman anthony weiner, the estranged husband of huma abedin, a top clinton aide. comey has said the emails appear to be pertinent, but may or may not be significant, to its initial investigation of clinton's private server. the reemergence of the email issue is making it difficult for clinton to end her campaign on a positive note as she had hoped.  after highlighting her rí©sumí©, clinton has been quickly pivoting to attacks on the republican nominee before outlining the specifics of her proposals. ""i truly believe you need a candidate to vote for, not just someone to vote against,"" she said in arizona wednesday. ""but if we're going to make this choice next tuesday, we need to be clear on what the choice is."" ""if donald trump were to win this election, we would have a commander in chief who is completely out of his depth"" and whose ideas ""are dangerous,"" said clinton. clinton's stop in red-tilting arizona, where she drew an estimated 15,000 supporters to a field in tempe, was an effort to project strength. but on friday, she's jetting to michigan, a state with strong labor ties and that polls show she should  carry. she's also dropping new television ads in michigan and new mexico, another blue state she needs to win, and returning to the airwaves in colorado and virginia, states from which she'd previously shifted resources as polling showed her with large advantages. the blitz is a result of new fundraising dollars that have poured in in the aftermath of the comey announcement, said palmieri. ""if we've seen any effect of james comey's letter, it is to be a motivating factor for our supporters,"" she told reporters en route to las vegas. yet republicans are escalating their attacks, with trump even urging voters in wisconsin to go back and change their votes for clinton. trump is trying to set her back in traditionally blue states like wisconsin, which he visited on tuesday and may return to in the coming days. a new ad from future45, a pro-trump super pac, is attempting to compare clinton to richard nixon. recently, clinton's confidence in her lead had allowed her to spend time focusing on helping elect more democrats to the senate. she was joined by democratic senate candidates at her rallies as she slammed sitting republicans, such as pennsylvania's pat toomey and north carolina's richard burr",NEWS; Pg. 4A,USA TODAY,"Clinton hammers 'dangerous' Trump; Democrat aims to boost black turnout, avoids email talk",11/4/16

""as divisive, surprising and objectionable as campaigns often are, in the end voters go with their pocketbook,"" says patrick anderson, ceo of anderson economic group this model starts with the assumption most americans generally reward the incumbent party with their vote when the economy is good and punish them when it's not. anderson says aeg's model has predicted the largest vote-getter in 22 of the past 25 elections and every election since 1980. at the moment, pocketbook issues are trending higher, which favors clinton. the nation's 5% unemployment rate is down from its peak of 10% in october 2009. wages have risen five months in a row and inflation remains tame. then there's baseball ... the  ""world series presidential predictor"" gives the edge to clinton. so democrats can thank the chicago cubs. in the 1972 inaugural issue of the baseball research journal, a study of world series results between 1952 and 1968 found the democratic candidate  won the election every time a national league team won the world series; the republican candidate was victorious if an american league team won. the cubs hail from the nl. this baseball indicator, when stretched out to include presidential elections from 1908 thru 2012, is less illuminating, as its accuracy is 55",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Cubs say Clinton, but Stocks TAP Trump; Presidential polls are too close to call.

""they just want a great experience for television."" comcast customers who are already netflix subscribers will need to sign in to netflix once after their x1 box updates. comcast subscribers who do not currently use netflix can sign up on the system and be billed monthly by comcast. neither company would comment on the terms of their agreement, but netflix generally shares some revenue from new subscribers with device makers and mobile providers. hastings, a comcast xfinity customer, said the integration has ""the most convenient ui (user interface) we've ever had."" netflix has partnered with smaller u.s. pay-tv providers before and in september announced a major integration deal with liberty global, which has more than 29 million customers in 30-plus countries. the comcast deal, hastings said, is ""a big boost in the number of households that can get netflix on their tv."" that could help boost netflix's slowing u.s. subscriber growth, currently at 47 million. so far, its 2.76 million domestic subscribers added over the first nine months of 2016 represent a 32% decline from new additions over the same period last year. comcast has seen benefits from its x1 platform, which it began rolling out in 2012. while the overall pay-tv industry has seen a decline in subscribing homes, comcast has added 170,000 video subscribers over the past 12 months.

" trump might be  ill-suited to serve as a healer. but that does not mean the nation cannot be healed. other countries roiled by conflict have tackled the issue of reconciliation -- and essentially come up with a formula. several years ago, inspired by covering the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa, i set off on an odyssey to better understand the  process. the journey took me to peru, ghana, east timor and other countries that had recovered from devastating conflicts. if those countries are a guide, reconciliation begins with seeking the truth, while acknowledging the grievances of the distressed and providing some way to address the damage. lessons in south africa none of the reconciliation efforts was  perfect. even south africa's, which became the gold standard, was not nearly as successful as it was generally thought. though it provided mesmerizing glimpses of tearful perpetrators apologizing to those they had wronged, most victims received only a fraction of the compensation they had expected and many never had the satisfaction of seeing wrongdoers accept responsibility. one woman i interviewed was gang raped and tortured by several cops. when she confronted one of the officers at the tribunal, he deflected responsibility by claiming not to know her. despite its imperfections, the  process played an essential role in helping the country avoid a descent into unending violence. and it provided a means to begin to address the pain and conflict of apartheid. anglican archbishop desmond tutu, the truth and reconciliation commission chair, described to me a sermon he had delivered at an  afrikaans church during which he spoke of the chemical and biological warfare  the commission had uncovered. ""one of the six ministers of that church then came up into the pulpit where i was standing. and he was in tears because he said he had been an ordained minister for over 30 years and also been a chaplain of the defense force and he had not known about these things. ... what he really wanted to say was, 'can you forgive us?'"" tutu recalled. in a village in peru in peru's conflict  against the guerrilla group  shining path, one day the military arrived at a village and carried off  people who were never heard from again. one villager told me that people came to a truth commission hearing hoping to learn the truth -- which, he made clear, was a starting point for healing and justice. america is not peru. nor it is east timor, where citizens armed by a foreign power brutalized their countrymen. nor is it ghana, suffering through the aftermath of a coup that saw soldiers torture civilians. our conflict in america is  an altogether different scale, though it is serious enough. as historian stephanie coontz observed, the trump campaign ""has mobilized the crudest alliance of racists, nativists, misogynists and 'know-nothings' that america has seen in any national election since before world war ii."" it also unloosed fear and dread in latino and muslim communities, and anger and resentment -- already brought to a boil by police shootings and other tragedies -- among blacks. and it drew the wrath of countless women. the beginning of reconciliation in america, as elsewhere, will be in acknowledging the grievances of the affected groups -- including blue-collar white males, many of whom ""have been deeply wronged by the system that trump claims to attack,"" as coontz pointed out. coming back from the brink also entails recognition of a difficult truth: all the pain, anger and resentment stirred up by the campaign was not created by the campaign. much of it was present all along, just waiting for a candidate like trump to set things off. while our democracy is much too strong to be taken down by a potty-mouthed billionaire with a temper, it can be deeply damaged by a refusal to acknowledge and address the marginalization and suffering of so many among us. occupy wall street, black lives matter, the bernie sanders movement and the trump campaign all speak to a failure in how america works for many of its less privileged citizens. the challenge of a new administration will be not just putting the conflict of the campaign behind us but also addressing those deeper, pre-existing needs",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"How can America heal as one?; First, acknowledge grievances that existed before the Trump campaign",11/4/16
" since the practice began to spread in the 1990s, the likelihood of late-breaking, game-changing developments has been thought to be quite low, and perhaps this election is atypical. yet if the information voters would get up to election day would change the outcome of only one in five u.s. presidential races, the costs to democracy are huge. early voting means that different voters are voting on a different choice proposition. the choice between donald trump and hillary clinton before the revelation of trump's  comments about women is not the same choice as after. the choice between them is not the same after revelations of a justice department investigation into clinton's emails. yet in some places, ballots were already cast even before either development. the point of adversary elections is to get the most relevant information to voters. discovering this information about the candidates takes time -- and early voters do not get the benefit of this. the less information voters have, the more they are likely to vote based on non-candidate specific factors such as political party. that turns an election from a deliberative choice between voters to an identity-based one, and entrenches partisanship. today, there is great concern about the possibility that the election results would not be seen as valid by the losing side. the legitimacy of a result can only be weakened by anger and frustration over votes cast before important revelations emerge. supporters of early voting say it promotes participation by voters with 9-to-5 jobs, and by racial minorities. the former can easily be addressed by moving election day to a weekend. changing rules to increase minority turnout is imperative if we discover arrangements designed to suppress their participation. but there is no suggestion that the venerable institution of ""election day"" was created as a tool of disenfranchisement",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Early voting distorts elections,11/4/16

" rather than indulging in backbiting postmortems on what went wrong, they must  immediately try to find a new sense of purpose and unity. here are three places to start: stop demonizing the opposition. during a relentlessly depressing campaign, voters have heard far more about conservative outrage toward president obama and hillary clinton than about gop visions for positive reform. just as obama took office, the nation's most influential conservative commentator expressed his desire to see him fail. some republicans sought to disqualify obama as an illegitimate usurper through the birther canard, or attacked him as determined to destroy the nation he had been elected to serve. the same tone persisted against clinton, with ugly chants of ""lock her up!"" appealing solely to right-wing true believers. most of the public craves collaboration and progress in washington. you can't achieve that if you're promising to throw your opponents in jail or warning of their evil intentions. don't make absurd promises that can't be kept. in the final stages of his campaign, trump has downplayed the far-fetched pledge to build a big, beautiful impenetrable border wall and handing mexico the bill. not even a president with magical deal-making prowess could deliver on that. other gop promises to obliterate obamacare or to shut down the government are comparably preposterous. similarly, republicans should stop sloganeering about ""closing the border"" and deporting untold millions, and promote meaningful changes instead. push radical reform of the nomination process. republicans must scrap the endless, incomprehensible system that shattered their party and produced the least popular nominee in history. most obviously, it makes no sense for iowa and new hampshire to continue their outsize role in winnowing the field. primaries should be concentrated in a brief period with multiple primaries on each of four pre-selected days of early spring. the top two finishers would proceed to a national primary and run together on the fall ticket in order of their finish. these reformist resolutions would help republicans rebuild from the image-wrecking excesses of 2016, regardless of which party captures the white house. if trump wins,  they would generate more support than tearing up trade deals, jailing opponents or shattering overseas alliances. and if clinton assumes power, a fresh approach that transcends the disasters and distortions of the recent past could empower a new generation of gop leaders to rebuild credibility as a loyal opposition that can work with and not against the interests of the new administration, while bringing new confidence to a deeply dispirited nation",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Win or lose, GOP needs to unify and change",11/4/16

" 8, more than 34 million americans have already cast their ballots, turning election day into what's more accurately called ""election weeks."" early voting is, for the most part, an idea that has caught on for all the right reasons. early voting thins out the crowds on election day, preventing long lines that have marred past elections. it boosts turnout. it reduces the chances that bad weather on election day will affect the outcome. and it increases voting opportunities for working people who often lack the flexible schedules needed to get to the polls on a tuesday. nearly 40 states allow early voting, and one problem is that some have taken this good thing too far. six -- iowa, minnesota, new jersey, south dakota, vermont and wyoming -- start voting in late september, about the time of the first presidential debate this year. that's too early. the public learns a lot about candidates as campaigns progress, a point certainly proven in this year's presidential race. early voting ought to be confined to the period between the final presidential debate (oct. 19 this time around) and election day. another problem, exacerbated by the popularity of early voting, is interminable waits that have marred the process in parts of arizona, georgia, massachusetts and texas this fall. if states provide early voting, they ought to provide enough equipment, staff and locations to do it right. a far more insidious problem has developed since 2011 and needs correction. republican-led legislatures in more than a half-dozen states have attacked this once bipartisan, good-government policy and cut back early voting in ways that suppress african-american voters, who tend to back democrats. in wisconsin, for example, legislators restricted early voting to weekdays and limited cities, even large ones such as milwaukee, to a single early voting location. in july, a federal judge struck down parts of the state's voting law, ruling they were unconstitutional. the most blatant suppression effort came in north carolina, where in 2013 the gop-dominated legislature sought data on early voting in the two previous presidential elections and discovered that a larger percentage of african americans than white voters used early voting, particularly during its first week and on sundays. lawmakers then voted to cut the first week and eliminate one of two early voting sundays. those facts are ""as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times,"" a federal appeals panel wrote in july, barring the state from imposing this and other voting restrictions. even after the federal ruling, north carolina's republican-run county election boards, which were still in control of voting hours and locations, continued to cut early voting hours below what they had been in 2012, when about 36% of votes nationally, including absentee ballots, were cast before election day. there is no excuse for such actions in a nation where voting is a sacred right and the highest  turnout in recent years was 62%, in 2008. and there's nothing wrong with giving voters who've made up their minds the opportunity to vote early",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,"Let voting start early, just not too early",11/4/16

" kneel at the water's edge and you can hear it; a whispery gurgle as the water moves across the rocks that delineate the river from the lake. a downstream riffle is barely discernible, but it is clearly the beginning point. the mississippi is america's national river, the seam that  binds and bounds the nation. the country's consciousness courses through its waters. mark twain saw to that. while the mississippi has been somewhat corralled by dams and levees, the great river follows its own path, occasionally running wild, pushing towns, cities and citizens aside. the source of the mississippi had been known to native americans for centuries. then in 1832, henry schoolcraft, a territorial superintendent for indian affairs stationed in sault ste. marie, canada, headed west, his assignment unclear. but for a dozen years schoolcraft had been itching to locate the headwaters. he was convinced that an 1820 excursion identifying cass lake as the mississippi's source had been in error. he met an ojibwe leader named ozawindib who agreed to guide schoolcraft to the beginnings of ""gichizibbi,"" an ojibwe word meaning ""great water."" mississippi derives from the algonquin word ""misiziibi."" they arrived on july 13. ""schoolcraft did officially discover it,""  says sandra lichter, an itasca state park naturalist who is well versed in the headwaters' history. ""but if you have someone show you, did you really discover it? and would he have found the headwaters without help? that's a good question. schoolcraft had an idea where it was. but he got very lucky when he encountered ozawindib."" most visitors today barely notice lake itasca, which covers about 1.8 square miles and spawns the river. they come for the mississippi, which flows northward from the lake, then winds eastward for about 100 miles before bending south. today the headwaters are the centerpiece of itasca state park, a 33,235-acre slice of north woods between the towns of bemidji and park rapids. there is more here than the mississippi's beginnings, of course. thousands of timbered acres, including a few centuries-old pines. more than 100 glacial lakes. miles of hiking, biking and snowmobiling trails. deer, eagles, hawks, upland game, small game, waterfowl, black bears, gray wolves, bass, walleye, pike, muskellunge and more. nearly 2,000 acres are set aside as a wilderness sanctuary. but the mississippi headwaters have an almost mythic hold on visitors. more than 500,000 people annually visit the park. nearly all make the pilgrimage to the mississippi's beginnings, which are a bit overdone -- touristy but not tacky -- and include a live webcam (dnr.state.mn.us). step just a short distance off the beaten path, however, and the solitude of the pine forest returns. ""we like to say that people come for the headwaters and return for the trees,"" says park lead interpreter connie cox. ""but yes, itasca is known for having the headwaters of the mississippi river."" the name says as much. the ojibwe knew the lake as ""omushkos,"" which means ""elk lake."" the word itasca was a schoolcraft creation; a combination from parts of two latin words (veritas and caput) meaning ""truth"" and ""head."" schoolcraft wouldn't have any trouble locating the headwaters today, but he might not recognize the spot when he got here. in 1832, he would have found a small stream emerging from a weedy, swampy, thriving, wild mess. logging around 1900 soiled this fragile ecosystem. in the early part of the 20th century, park officials -- hoping to lure visitors with more attractive surroundings -- recommended the first 2,000 or so feet of the mississippi river be cleaned up. in stepped the civilian conservation corps.  the original channel was restored. trees were planted. a low concrete dam was built at the outlet. most visitors are unaware of the dam, which is 44 feet long, 7 feet wide and unseen. its purpose is not to dam the lake but stabilize the outflow. the dam is topped with rocks. it's an unofficial rite of passage for visitors to walk across the rocks or wade the mississippi just below the structure. a wooden walkway flanks the shoreline for about one-third of a mile, then crosses the river before intersecting the schoolcraft trail. on a cool, early october morning a couple dozen people milled around the headwaters; wading and snapping selfies by a carved post, which reads: ""here 1475 ft above the ocean the mighty mississippi begins to flow on its winding way 2552 miles to the gulf of mexico"" a river is always moving, shifting, changing. the u.s. geological survey now estimates the mississippi's  length at 2,340 miles. it begins as a clear, cool 45-degree rivulet. ""it has just enough agitation that it won't freeze,"" cox says.  ""in my (21) years here, i've never seen it freeze."" it has had plenty of chances. cox recalls the coldest day she has experienced. ""it was minus 60,  and that was without the wind chill,"" she says.  ""but the water was still flowing. a cloud of steam was coming up because the water temperature was 45 degrees and it was 105 degrees warmer ... than it was in the air",LIFE; Pg. 3D,USA TODAY,Where the begins; Once-elusive headwaters have become a pilgrimage for visitors to Minnesota,11/4/16
" roomy, comfortable and loaded with  modern conveniences, it's a competent big car that people already inclined to like lincoln should love, but it's unlikely to draw many new buyers to ford's luxury brand. it's a large and roomy luxury sedan with an attractive interior and modern features, but the continental's styling and performance betray the fact that it's based on essentially the same structure as the lincoln mks it replaces. lincoln engineers reworked the existing architecture as thoroughly as they could. the continental's wheelbase and track are unique. i tested a well-equipped all-wheel-drive reserve edition with the 400-horsepower v-6. its features included revel audio, 30-way power heated and cooled front seats, heated steering wheel, navigation, bluetooth phone and audio compatibility, apple carplay, navigation, large power sunroof, inflatable rear seat belts, 20-inch polished aluminum wheels and more. it stickered at $72,560. all prices exclude destination charges. the continental competes with large front-wheel-drive based luxury sedans such as the buick lacrosse and cadillac xts. it could conceivably also compete with hyundai's new genesis g90, a rear-wheel-drive based large sedan that hopes to crack the luxury market. like the continental, those cars offer all-wheel drive. the engine produced plenty of power. it's a heavy car, though. lincoln only provides the curb weight of a base 3.7-liter front-wheel-drive model, but even that's a few pounds heavier than the cadillac xts with similar horsepower. the continental accelerates well in a straight line, but its heft -- and an aging architecture that dates to when ford owned volvo -- reveals itself in hard acceleration and quick maneuvers. lincoln's adjustable dampers reduce that, but the continental doesn't challenge the handling of leading contemporary luxury sedans. exterior styling sets a new course, with a tall and formal profile, big rectangular grille, innovative door handles integrated into the chrome strip running along the bottom of the windows, long roofline and vaguely bentley-esque rear fenders. the conti's best side is inside. my car's seats, doors and dash had black leather, and warm brown wood decorated the steering wheel, doors and center console. the 30-way front seats provide a wide range of adjustments and a massage feature that should be useful on long drives. the optional revel audio system has precisely machined bright aluminum speaker grilles. the 2017 continental is a significant improvement for lincoln. it's a car likely to delight the brand's loyalists and dealers, if not one destined to lure buyers from other luxury marques. power: plenty of oomph from the largest engine. heft: it's heavy -- and handles that way. controls: easy to use, a welcome change. what? a full-size luxury sedan. where? made in flat rock, mich. when? in showrooms now. how big? 16.8 feet. what makes it go? choice of three v-6s at 305 horsepower, 335 horsepower or 400 horsepower. how thirsty? rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city, 24 mpg on the highway and 19 mpg overall. how much? starts at $44,500, including destination charges, but goes north of $72,000 with higher trim levels and options",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"Continental inches luxury brand forward; Lincoln sedan is roomy, comfort- able and loaded but unlikely to draw many new buyers",11/4/16
" it will mean drivers of electric cars and trucks won't have to worry about finding a charging station along 25,000 miles of highway in 35 states. transportation department officials announced thursday that a consortium of states, utilities and vehicle manufacturers have agreed to accelerate the deployment of ev charging stations along the corridors. officials did not specify the routes in a release announcing the news. the department of energy plans to conduct two studies related to the push in early 2017. the first is a national ev infrastructure analysis to identify the optimal number of charging stations for different ev markets. the second will provide best practices for ev station installation, including location siting, power availability and capital and maintenance cost considerations. the energy department also got 38 additional businesses, non-profits, universities and utilities to sign on to its workplace charging challenge, which is designed to provide ev charging access for employees. the ev charging station initiative comes on the heels of this summer's obama administration announcement of $4.5 billion in loan guarantees to support commercial-scale deployment of such stations. among the companies that have committed to helping deploy more charging facilities are electric car manufacturers such as bmw, gm  and nissan",MONEY; Pg. 5B,USA TODAY,"Feds back EV charging network over 25,000 miles of highways; Exact locations, route still being worked out but will cover 35 states",11/4/16
" as it rolled up to a hangar in eastern north carolina on the campaign's final weekend, the theme from air force one blaring away, donald trump's supporters waved signs and snapped cellphone photos while eagerly awaiting the presidential candidate's final argument -- one that targets the american political system generally and hillary clinton, in particular. ""to all americans i say it's time for change,"" trump told his backers while echoing themes he has used for more than 16 months on the campaign trail. ""it's time for new leadership."" the new york businessman, apprentice star, and novice politician took that message this weekend from the coast of north carolina to the casinos of nevada, from the rocky mountains of colorado to the shuttered steel mills of western pennsylvania, promising a new approach on issues like trade, immigration, terrorism, foreign policy and the work of the federal government itself. the republican candidate claims he will rework trade agreements that he alleges have sent jobs overseas and tighten immigration policies that currently permit ""open borders."" he pledges to curtail ""government corruption"" with a program that includes restrictions on lobbying by ex-government officials and term limits for members of congress. he vows to repeal obamacare and ""rebuild our badly depleted military."" above all, however, trump is selling himself: an ""outsider"" businessman who will shake up a ""failed"" political establishment. ""at the heart of this election is a simple question,"" trump told backers sunday in sioux city, iowa. ""will our country be governed by the people or will it be governed by the corrupt political class? we're going to find out very soon."" the candidate also found himself rewriting the script as he crossed the country sunday, reacting to an fbi disclosure that -- as the bureau first announced in july -- it would not recommend charges against clinton over her use of private email while at the state department, a flap that has fueled trump's campaign in recent days. while trump did not specifically cite the fbi announcement during a rally in minneapolis, he did tell supporters: ""you have to understand: it's a rigged system and she's protected."" the clinton campaign and trump's many other critics have no doubt he would radically overhaul the government -- and that's the problem. the results would include expensive trade wars with economic competitors and heightened  tensions with other countries, trump's opponents say. they warn that an ""unstable"" and volatile person such as trump should not be allowed near the nuclear button. ""imagine how easily it could be that donald trump would feel insulted and start a real war -- not just a twitter war -- at 3 o'clock in the morning,"" clinton told supporters this weekend in pittsburgh. to trump's many fans, his  lack of government experience is an asset.

" from nevada to north carolina and florida to michigan, the democratic presidential nominee is asking americans to ""imagine"" what it would be like to have the real estate billionaire occupy the oval office beginning in january. ""this is one of those make-or-break moments for the united states,"" clinton told a couple thousand supporters friday night at heinz field in pittsburgh. ""imagine,"" she said, that on inauguration day, ""it is donald trump standing in front of the capitol."" in the final days of the campaign, clinton's closing argument is less about the finer points of her policy proposals and more that nov. 8 amounts to a referendum on the ""dark"" and ""divisive"" vision of trump. clinton has sought to keep the focus on trump's negatives in the campaign's closing days, particularly following the fbi's surprise announcement late last month that it was reviewing additional emails potentially related to the investigation of the former secretary of state's private server. on sunday, however, fbi director james comey informed lawmakers that after reviewing the communications, the bureau was not changing its conclusions from july that no criminal charges should be filed. ""we're glad that this matter is resolved,"" clinton communications director jennifer palmieri told reporters aboard the campaign's plane sunday. trump, the democratic nominee says, demeans women and minorities; mocks people with disabilities; owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks; would bring back ""trickle-down economics"" benefiting the rich; has a hot temper that could start a nuclear war; and might not respect the democratic tradition of honoring the election outcome. her surrogates are also laying out the stakes: ""basic human decency is on the ballot nov. 8,"" katie mcginty, the pennsylvania democratic candidate for senate, said at a philadelphia concert saturday night. the strategy of going on offense caps a campaign that's taken personal insults to a new low and features candidates who are highly unpopular by historical standards. despite a convention in july in philadelphia that emphasized her biography of helping children and families and that improved her favorability numbers -- they remain around 46% as of late october, around 20 points lower than barack obama's in november 2008. hence hitting trump is probably a more effective means of turning out core democratic voters -- especially african americans and millennials -- than trying to excite them about the specifics of her ideas. the race is tightening in the homestretch of the campaign, both nationally and in battlegrounds like new hampshire, where trump appears to have erased clinton's earlier advantage. the campaign says a new ""clinton coalition"" is beginning to take shape -- and it includes large numbers of latinos, asians, suburban women, african americans and millennials. these groups, said campaign manager robby mook, amount to a ""firewall against a trump victory."" clinton is maintaining her lead in most of the states she would need to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win, including virginia, colorado and across much of the rust belt. ""the map has been consistent for us,"" campaign chairman john podesta told reporters friday aboard clinton's campaign plane. yet their concerns, particularly about african-american turnout and maintaining president obama's winning coalition, are clear. clinton is jetting to michigan, a state that had been considered safe, twice in the final days of her sprint. she spent her evenings in recent days at large rallies headlined by pop stars, including pharrell williams in north carolina, beyonce and jay-z in cleveland and katy perry in philadelphia",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,CANDIDATES MAKE CLOSING ARGUMENTS; Clinton tries to keep focus on her opponent,11/7/16
" before we heal as a nation, we've got to start healing as individuals. so many people who voted for the losing side will have passionately supported donald trump, hillary clinton or another candidate. how do we get over this? it will take patience, empathy and effort. to help with that, usa today sought out expert advice on how to deal with post-election dejection. here's the 12-step action plan: 1 feel free to scream. just don't do it in a public place. ""if you are really, really upset and want to yell, go in the bathroom and close the door and yell,"" psychotherapist fran sherman says. ""you have to get it out."" this type of ""verbal vomit"" can be helpful, she says: ""i equate it to when you are sick to your stomach and you let it out and you feel better."" not a screamer? aerobic activity, which will release feel-good endorphins, is a good way to shed some angst, she says. 2 practice acceptance. feel better after that therapeutic scream? good. now you can think more clearly and face the facts. ""you don't have to like it to accept that it's the reality,"" says psychologist vaile wright, who is a member of the american psychological association's stress in america team. ""say to yourself, 'i don't like this outcome, but this is the way it is and i'm going to move forward.' fighting it is just going to prolong one's disappointment."" 3 take action. decide what you can do to make a difference, wright says. for instance, volunteer with a group that supports an election issue that was important to you. ""disappointment can motivate  us to action - ideally in a positive way,"" she says. this can make people feel empowered, adds psychologist mary alvord. ""you're not helpless, you're not a victim,"" she says. ""focus on what you can control. ... take your passion and put it into some kind of action."" 4 create an exit plan. no -- not to leave the country. have a strategy that lets you gracefully exit any anxiety-provoking political conversation, politely change the topic or ably defuse tension. it may be saying something like, ""we've got to take this one day at a time,"" agreeing to disagree on a subject or offering your own post-election stress-relieving tips, says psychologist nancy molitor. ""the idea is to not escalate the conversation and to remain neutral,"" she says. 5 heed your early-warning signs. ""pay attention to your body and your brain,"" molitor says. ""if you start to think, 'this person is an idiot' and 'i can't believe they are saying this,' recognize that it's only going to escalate."" there are signs when we start to get worked up, such as a tight throat, a dry mouth, a tight back or a shrill voice, so ""know your triggers,"" she advises. 6 manage your exposure. ""we all know who those problem people are in our lives, whether it's the guy in the cubicle next to us at work or the cousin on facebook who keeps talking about a candidate,"" molitor says. if certain in-person conversations, social media posts or tv outlets fuel aggravation or depression, then avoid those or limit exposure. ""if two people at work are spouting things, then avoid getting into a conversation with them,"" she says. ""don't engage."" 7 think broadly. ""try to understand that people are not crazy just because they are supporting another side,"" molitor says. ""it doesn't make them a villain."" practice kindness and empathy, says david palmiter, a professor of psychology at marywood university in scranton, pa. sure, it can be challenging at times, but ""it is possible to be empathetic  with someone and disagree with their thoughts,"" he says. ""people who are therapists learn that quickly."" 8 build a support system. it's ok to vent -- people want their feelings to be heard and acknowledged, says palmiter. just do it in a healthy, self-controlled way. ""talk to other people who you think are positive and support you,"" advises psychologist alvord. 9 slow down and self-soothe. this is an ideal time to try meditation. ""it's not nearly as hard as people think,"" psychologist elaine ducharme says. too woo-woo for you? then employ other relaxation methods such as listening to music, lying on a beach or even riding a motorcycle, if that's what gives you some inner peace, she says. 10 be thankful. think of what you are grateful for, even if it's just small things, psychotherapist sherman says. it can be ""i'm grateful that it's a sunny day"" or ""i'm grateful to have good friends,"" she says. ""when you feed your brain that positive information, you feel better."" 11 get some perspective. ""turn on a comedy, watch a classic movie or turn off the tv and go for a walk,"" suggests molitor. ""be with your animals or kids or grandkids. do something to get out of that silo."" remember, ""there are checks and balances in the system,"" she says, so ""try to keep the big picture. ... life will go on. it may go on differently, but it will go on."" 12 model good behavior. this is a great opportunity to show children how to deal with disappointment. ""we can teach kids to be a gracious loser,"" says alvord. that good behavior can go beyond educating kids.

" your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams. i've been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make america great again. real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing obamacare -- americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof. it also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed american jobs and crushed american incomes. this means renegotiating bill and hillary clinton's disastrous nafta and china deals that have deindustrialized the united states -- importing unemployment and exporting our wealth. it means we don't have to keep kids trapped in failing schools -- that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income african-american and hispanic children who have been failed for generations by democratic politicians like hillary clinton. real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in washington. we must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. if we want to make america great again, we must clean up this corruption. hillary clinton has been the subject of an fbi criminal investigation into  many crimes against this nation. were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis -- hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt. america has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation. it is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people. that's what i'm offering in my contract with the american voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to washington. it's there for you to read at www.thetrumpcontract.com. in my contract with the american voter, i offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. we will cut taxes on middle-class americans by 35%. we will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. we will repeal and replace catastrophic obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. and we will end the offshoring of american jobs. in my contract, i also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country. hillary has pledged ""open borders,"" mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in syrian refugees. america's immigration officers described hillary's extremist plan as ""the most radical immigration agenda proposal in u.s. history."" i will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate supreme court justices who will do the same. finally, i pledge to fight for the right of every child in american to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities. i am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the white house. together, we will take our government back from the special interests -- and we will make america great again. donald j",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,CLOSING ARGUMENTS; Why you should vote for me,11/7/16
" things are going to change -- that much is certain. the question is, what kind of change are we going to have? we can build an economy that works for everyone, or stack the deck even more for those at the top. we can keep america safe through strength and smarts -- or turn our backs on our allies, and cozy up to our adversaries. we can come together to build a stronger, fairer america, or fear the future and fear each other. everything i've done, as first lady, senator, or secretary of state, i've done by listening to people and looking for common ground, even with people who disagree with me. and if you elect me on tuesday, that's the kind of president i'll be. here are four priorities for my first 100 days -- issues i've heard about from americans all over our country. first, we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii. we'll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come. we'll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in america within a decade. we'll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire -- because in america, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. we'll pay for it all by asking the wealthy, wall street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share. and this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days. creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency. second, we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation. the last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was ronald reagan, and it was a priority for george w. bush. i'm confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship, secures our border, and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals. this is the right thing to do, and it will also grow our economy. third, to break the gridlock in washington, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics. it's drowning out the voices of the american people. so within my first 30 days, i will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united. we should be protecting citizens' rights to vote, not corporations' rights to buy elections. fourth, we need to get started on end-to-end criminal justice reform. too many people have been sent away for far too long for non-violent offenses. i believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. there's so much more we need to do together, and we certainly won't get it all done in the first 100 days. but we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for american families -- and i'll never, ever quit. i want to be president for all americans -- democrats, republicans and independents; americans of every race, faith and background. my opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness, fear and insults, and spent months pitting americans against each other. i've said many times that donald trump has shown us who he is. now we have to decide who we are. because it's not just our names on the ballot this year. every issue we care about is on the ballot, too. this is about who we are as a country -- and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together, or change that pushes us further apart. it all comes down to this. i love our country. i believe in our people. and i think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and invest in each other",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,CLOSING ARGUMENTS; Why you should vote for me,11/7/16
" in a letter to lawmakers, comey said the fbi is standing by its original findings, made in july, that clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of state. ""the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,"" comey said in the letter. ""during that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state,"" comey wrote. ""based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions."" comey had rocked the presidential race with his announcement oct. 28 that the fbi had uncovered a new trove of emails that might be relevant to the investigation of clinton's use of a private email server. the emails were discovered on the computer of anthony weiner, the estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin. the announcement, as voters prepare to head to the polls tuesday, added more drama to an already turbulent campaign season. clinton was en route to cleveland on sunday when comey issued his letter. aboard her plane, aides were seen sharing the letter on their wireless devices. clinton communications director jennifer palmieri came to the back of the plane where the news media  sits to discuss the letter. ""we are glad to see that he has found -- and we were confident that he would -- that he has confirmed the conclusion he reached in july; and we're glad that this matter is resolved,"" she told reporters. the campaign appeared to signify it would not gloat over the announcement; palmieri declined to answer questions as she customarily does. in a speech later sunday at the cleveland public auditorium, clinton made no mention of the fbi announcement or -- notably -- trump. her remarks were far more positive than the stump speech she's been delivering in recent days. ""i know there's a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season,"" said clinton, but anger is not a plan. clinton's commanding 11-point lead after the final debate with republican donald trump in las vegas has narrowed to  4 to  5 points nationally in the aftermath of comey's late october announcement. she's seen trump close in on her in states like new hampshire and michigan, where she'd once enjoyed a comfortable lead. though there is no way to tell how much of that is related to the announcement -- versus a natural tightening of the race -- the campaign has privately worried that the surprise announcement would badly damage their attempts to court republicans disillusioned with trump. campaigning in minnesota, trump did not specifically mention comey's announcement but appeared to allude to it. clinton is ""protected by a rigged system,"" he said. ""she shouldn't be allowed to run for president."" comey's brief written notice to congress on sunday was issued after consultation with attorney general loretta lynch, a federal law enforcement official said. the official who is not authorized to comment publicly said both sides agreed on the conclusion, which was reached earlier sunday. the official said the investigative team that conducted the initial inquiry into clinton's handling of classified information as secretary of state worked night and day to review hundreds of thousands of communications as part of the new review. the official said many of the communications involved in the new review were duplicates of emails analyzed during the initial inquiry. in a brief written statement sunday, the justice department said it had ""dedicated all necessary resources to conduct this review expeditiously."" since notifying congressional leaders of the new review oct. 28, comey had been the target of withering criticism for departing from long-standing justice department policy against taking politically charged actions in close proximity to an election. among the sharpest rebukes came from former attorney general eric holder who was among nearly 100 former justice officials who expressed their objections in a letter circulated last week. comey's original decision to notify federal lawmakers of the new review went against lynch's advice. the fbi's action also exposed deep rifts within the bureau as agents not only pursued questions about hillary clinton's emails but also about a now-stalled preliminary inquiry involving the clinton foundation. supporters awaiting clinton's campaign appearance sunday in cleveland greeted the news with a mix of relief and concern. ""he just threw it out there without any examination,"" bonnie weinstein, a 49-year-old interior decorator visiting from new mexico, said of comey's late october announcement. ""i was very concerned because, when you have accusations like that, you have to be really sure,"" she said.

"s. presidential election. the possibility is slight, with risks lessened by the fractured, pre-digital nature of the national voting apparatus. still, fears that hackers -- perhaps from russia -- could instill doubts about the voting process via attacks on the internet infrastructure have put the cyber-security community on guard. in a way, they are girding for war, but the fronts are multiple and decentralized. although many are keeping low profiles, we know about some. the department of homeland security has been conducting cyber audits of state and local election systems since august, responding to requests from 46 states and 32 local election officials. indiana is setting up an election cyber war room. in washington, d.c., and on the ground in 26 states, the non-partisan election protection coalition will staff hotlines for voters and have an election geek squad ready for questions from jurisdictions. the election verification network has assembled an elite ""a-team"" of cryptographers, analysts and security experts who will make themselves available to any jurisdictions needing help on election day and in the vote counts that follow. not surprisingly, many details of these swat teams' plans are kept under wraps. ""best practices for cyber security means we don't tell people what they are,"" said the pennsylvania secretary of state's press secretary, wanda murren. federal authorities say the decentralized and antiquated nature of the country's vote-tabulation systems would be difficult to penetrate. the worry, instead, is focused on other disruptions. two federal officials told usa today there is concern systems unrelated to the country's vote-tabulation system could be targeted to raise anxiety as voters go to the polls tuesday. the officials, who are not authorized to comment publicly, said breaches could take the form of what's known as denial of service attacks, similar to last month's rolling operation that knocked a number of popular websites offline for hours. there was no specific or credible information, however, that such operations are being planned to disrupt the election. ""we have these concerns around every election, but i have to say that i think there is more of a concern this time than i've seen in the past,"" california rep. adam schiff, the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee, told cnn. of the cyber threat posed by russia, schiff said that the russian government had ""prepared the field if they wanted to escalate."" it's those concerns that have created an unprecedented level of preparation, both by government and civil society groups. the department of homeland security is working with state and local election officials to protect against cyber vulnerabilities, secretary of homeland security jeh johnson said in an interview last week. the cyber scans found some vulnerabilities, ""an open door here or there, which are being addressed after doing these assessments,"" he said. some states have received a more in-depth, on-site assessment from homeland security. ""there are fewer states that have gone to that extent. and i would expect and hope and expect that after the election more would do the same thing,"" johnson said. pennsylvania is one of the states that took advantage of the federal security check, which found its safety security measures were working well. in indiana, a public-private partnership of cyber-security experts from local universities, the state's cyber-security firms and state government and law enforcement has come together to support the state should anything occur. a ""war room"" will be set up at the security operations center of rook security in indianapolis, where the group's 30 or so members will spend election day, said rook ceo j.j. thompson.

""it seems like the woman gets away with a lot."" but absolutely nothing gets residents here as riled up as a comment clinton made on march 13 during a town hall discussion. speaking about climate change, greenhouse gases and renewable energy, clinton said something the people in craig can't forgive: ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business ..."" that comment came during a discussion about the importance of job retraining and helping coal miners learn skills for new jobs because the natural gas boom and efforts to fight climate change already are financially burdening coal mines. at this point, the shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewables seems all but inevitable. but that doesn't matter much right here, right now. because craig means coal. and for its residents, anything that feels like an attack on coal is an attack on them, their livelihood, their entire way of life. and that means, more than almost anywhere else, craig's fate seemingly hangs on election day. residents here see a clinton presidency as a death knell for their town. they believe clinton and the epa will continue president obama's efforts to tighten the laws governing coal-burning power plants, prompting them to just shut down rather than spend many more millions of dollars complying with clean air requirements. it's not an idle fear: one of the mines outside craig has already declared bankruptcy, although it's still operating. the three coal mines near craig help feed the two nearby power plants. they provide hundreds of good-paying jobs. being a republican is about as natural as breathing for these americans living far from the urban life of uber and grocery delivery and office jobs. in this county, republicans outnumber democrats 4-1. steve smith, 64, spent 35 years running a dragline at the trapper mine, tearing apart a mountainside to get at the coal beneath. now retired and nursing a broken wrist from a logging accident, smith has time to watch television political news. he's disgusted by what he sees and worries politicians are drifting too far from the founding fathers' ideals of limited government and personal responsibility. many people in craig are frustrated that federal officials give so much weight and attention to protecting obscure wildlife and don't do enough to respect another endangered species: the american coal miner, the rancher, those who live a western life, where posses helped bring outlaws to justice and the government was a distant presence. ""they overstep in a lot of places,"" smith says. so when a group of ranchers took over a federal wildlife refuge in oregon earlier this year, people like smith took notice. the ranchers, led by ammon bundy, argued the federal government was overstepping its authority in a variety of areas, especially in managing lands. an armed confrontation between one of the men and authorities left the protester dead, but a jury last month acquitted the remaining protesters of any federal crime. smith says he's impressed the bundy group ""stepped up"" and took over the malheur national wildlife refuge to protest. while people here are angry at the idea that clinton could become president, no one is ready to take such a drastic step to protect their livelihood. at least, not yet. ""would we take up arms? probably not,"" smith says. ""it would be hard to accept hillary. you'd still keep fighting the system, but the system is rigged."" danny griffith laughs at the idea of the residents of this coal mining town ever doing anything like the malheur protest. the owner of jw snack's bar, griffith depends heavily on the salaries of the coal miners and power plant workers, who buy cheeseburgers and beer and wings. still, he allows that tensions are running high here, so high that he's temporarily banned bar visitors from discussing presidential politics, religion or abortion. he considers the election the chance to ""pick the best loser"" and worries a clinton presidency will kill first the coal mines and power plants, then businesses like his, and then the entire town. post-election, griffith, 58, says most craig residents will be looking at their household finances. if clinton wins, he thinks those who can leave town will likely seek work elsewhere.

" all eight of the house incumbents seeking re-election in tennessee are expected to easily win another term. missouri doesn't have any competitive house races this year. even ohio -- the ultimate swing state -- is anything but a battleground for house seats this year. ""it's still remarkable in this volatile environment we aren't talking about a single competitive race in ohio,"" says  nathan gonzales, who tracks house races for the non-partisan rothenberg & gonzales political report. across much of the country, congressional races really aren't much of a race. the number of competitive house seats has been shrinking for years. just 40 of the 435 seats in the house are competitive this year, said david wasserman, who tracks house races for the non-partisan cook political report in washington. by comparison, more than 100 seats were competitive at this point in 2010. republicans went on to pick up 63 seats that year and rode a tidal wave of voter anger that swept them back into power for the first time since in four years. in 1994, there were 63 ""tossup"" congressional races across the country, according to the cook rating in october of that year. these days, an overwhelming number of house districts are one-sided in their partisan makeup, meaning they are virtually unwinnable for the other party. and in some cases, nobody even tries. in alabama, for example, three of the seven incumbents are unopposed. critics like to blame the lack of competitive seats on gerrymandering, or drawing the lines of congressional districts so that they benefit one party. but there's more to it than that, wasserman says. ""more and more people are living in neighborhoods where the vast majority of their friends and neighbors agree with their political values,"" he says. it's what kent syler, a political scientist at middle tennessee state university, calls the ""self-sorting of the population."" in other words, ""it's where you live, what color you are, even how often you go to church,"" he said. the absence of real competition in elections is the main reason congress is so polarized, syler says. ""when all you have to do is worry about winning the democratic or the republican primary, you move way too far left or too far right because you're always worried about somebody primarying you,"" he says. syler knows a lot about the ways of washington. he worked for more than two decades as the chief of staff to then-congressman bart gordon, a tennessee democrat who left office five years ago. at the time, gordon's district had a 50-50 split between democrats and republicans.

" it's all about which side we're on. that's why i don't do it. the more a vote has become a declaration of identity, the less comfortable i have become with having to declare myself. i say this as a journalist. but i am tempted to argue that this is a position that might be good for many more of us. how can we lessen partisanship and political blood enmity? well, build in some wiggle room. keep the debate open. you're not obliged to vote. so make that a philosophic choice. as we used to say, voting only encourages them. the disbelief and reflexive censure that greets my voting resistance -- ""you're kidding, right?"" -- is part of the modern idea that there is no room for neutrality. undecideds are, in modern political demographics, not thoughtful people but, in fact, unthoughtful. an avowedly undecided person is something else yet: morally suspect, even somehow casting an effective vote for the other side. i'm not disloyal ... or odd my lone vote does not, of course, matter. not just because i live in new york, with its doubtless electoral outcome, but because voting reflects mass rather than individual action. so how come even the considered non-voter is regarded as an odd duck, even a disloyal one? likely because it's an identity issue. we're all forced to choose who we are -- we all seem to want to choose. that's the new, and pugilistic, civic life. there isn't room for anything else. it used to be a point of pride among journalists not to vote. this was born of a sense of professionalism -- accountants should not be invested in the companies they audit. and because we knew too much about how the sausage was made. but, also, because, in the past, successful media spoke to all voters, not just a segment of them. but media, in recent years, has been transformed. it's a fragmented game. it's also, as costs have been cut, a young person's game, with many casting among their first votes as journalists -- they want them to count. they want to be counted. writing about politics is now the ne plus ultra of the profession, as writing about war once was, or sports or theater -- life and death, winners and losers, thumbs up or thumbs down (in the past politics was more remote and procedural). this has led to journalists being among the most engaged, passionate, partisan and dead-certain participants in the enterprise -- members of the media party. we're actors not observers. not voting frees  your mind if this election has involved a kind of  relaxing of all pretenses of neutrality -- institutions may still formally cling to it, but the twitter feeds of individual journalists give away that lie -- it has obviously been falling for years. as much as the news consumer is conscious and vexed about the issue of media bias, i'm not sure anyone would quite know what to do with an unbiased reporter or commentator, except to ignore such an outlier. that would be quite a faceless bore. in my case, while i don't eschew opinion, i find not voting lets me at least roam freely over a rainbow of them. voting -- if i had to vote, i would have to be a hillary person, which i would much prefer not to have to be -- is necessarily reductive. not voting, surprisingly liberating. i can be anybody i want on a given political day. i got here inadvertently. traversing decades of political hyperbole -- vietnam, watergate, reagan, abortion, impeachment, iraq, gay marriage, etc. -- i shared with my colleagues a sense of hyper civic passion and suffering. the larger and more pervasive media became, the more central being a journalist seemed. we are the people, or see ourselves as the people, truly at the forefront -- in a sense the ultimate voters. as the media became ever-more-fraught and competitive, we had to identify even more with the people who identified with us. we became not so much journalists as surrogates. a fortuitous development anyway, amid this great change in the media's basic function and professional sense, i moved from one neighborhood to another. and i was lazy. and couldn't quite get the web voter registration to work (it didn't seem to believe i existed). and, suddenly, not able to cast a vote, a weight lifted. the perspective shifted. i was perhaps like a retired person watching people go to work. off the treadmill. or, i perhaps understood a little better the ideal of a priest not having sex -- an ideal about as unpopular, and regarded as unnatural, as a journalist not having a political position. true, it's hard to be engaged in politics and not have a position, whether you admit it or not. but you might be surprised how much not voting lets a position become more fluid. and in fact makes you look at voters as people who, perhaps for the best of reasons, have not so much committed themselves as limited themselves. almost the entire point of a vote is to look at things as they are right now. sometimes on the very day of casting it. it might well be that this election, so certain just days ago, will be upended tomorrow. the most basic civic admonition is to vote out of a concern for the future. but voting by its nature is shortsighted -- it's now. not voting, not having to place a bet on the race at hand, actually helps with the long view -- much of what we think now, we won't think later; most of the people who we are willing to trust at this moment will likely come to disappoint us. and, also, from a civic point of view, journalists believe it's important to encourage and not to depress the vote. hence, for both civic and ratings reasons, the narrative is about conflict and swift resolution. that's the story we're telling -- and the one we believe because we have become so hotly a part of it. but what if we could step away? would we seem wiser? might we have a better influence by not so particularly trying to influence? everything seems to be riding on tuesday's  election. the very rules of politics and news are being rewritten by it, we are told. perhaps that is right. but as likely it is not. many voters will go to bed on tuesday or wake up wednesday thinking there is no future. many others will believe the future is theirs. not voting helps you recognize the fallacy of both views",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,"I won't be voting Tuesday, and here's why",11/7/16
" the prosecution said andrew caspersen, a scion of a wealthy business family, should get as much as a 15-year-plus prison sentence for executing a ponzi-like scam that collectively bilked about a dozen of his clients, family members and his investment company out of roughly $46million. the defense said caspersen never intended to steal and betray. asking for leniency, his attorney, paul shechtman, presented evidence to show the 40-year-old father of two had been gripped by a pathological gambling addiction. on the bench in the 14th-floor manhattan courtroom sat u.s. district judge jed rakoff, a renowned legal independent and author of a recent essay that almost seemed to foreshadow the proceeding. ""distinctions of intent frequently determine, as a matter of law, the difference between going to prison and going free,"" rakoff wrote in the new york review of books in his examination of neuroscience and the law. what ensued was a nearly three-hour debate over whether and how much gambling addiction should factor in the sentence -- complete with references to the gambler, a short novel by fyodor dostoyevsky. by the end, caspersen and his wife, christina, wept as they held one another in the courtroom. shechtman brushed away tears of his own. and manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara issued a statement that noted caspersen had been sentenced -- but made no comment on the punishment. the prosecution attacked the gambling addiction defense from the start. assistant u.s. attorney christine magdo argued that the 2014-16 scam run by the princeton university and harvard law school graduate had been carefully calculated. in a sentencing memo to the court, she noted that caspersen fooled his roughly dozen victims by incorporating sham entities with names similar to real private equity firms. the victims lost millions. some, investment professionals themselves, declined to present victim statements by name, fearing the reputational loss of being fooled. magdo added that caspersen used much of the scam proceeds to pay the mortgage and two home equity credit lines on a manhattan apartment, as well as a $3 million home in bronxville, a wealthy suburb of new york city. ""caspersen does not -- and, in fact, he cannot -- claim that his criminal conduct was the result of an irresistible impulse. rather, it was a product of his own volition, a choice that was complicated by his addiction to gambling,"" she wrote in a sentencing memo. shechtman submitted dozens of support letters to the court, including pleas for leniency from caspersen's wife, friends and even the doorman of his manhattan co-op. the defense also turned to scientific and financial trading experts. marc potenza, a yale university school of medicine psychiatry professor and mental health expert on addiction, examined caspersen and reviewed his health records in preparation for testifying at the sentencing hearing. ""mr. caspersen suffered from a severe gambling disorder, a mental illness, and there is little doubt that it contributed substantially to him losing his own money and seek money by fraud from others to continue on the same destructive path,"" potenza wrote in a letter to the court. ""i think he still meets the criteria for a severe gambling disorder,"" potenza testified. the defense also recruited bruce rosen, a stock options trading expert, to examine the options transactions caspersen executed with millions of dollars generated by the scam. caspersen worked at the park hill group, a spinoff from private equity giant blackstone that's now owned by investment bank pjt partners. he knew the financial world. but rosen, in a letter to the court, said caspersen's options trading pattern ""lacked rationality."" ""buying options in the way that he did may have satisfied some psychological need, but he was certain to lose all of his money,"" wrote rosen. citing the experts' conclusions, shechtman urged rakoff to weigh the ""tragic dimension"" of caspersen's gambling addiction. offering proof of the depth of that addiction, shechtman recounted caspersen's conduct while attending the hit broadway show hamilton with his wife -- continually checking his cell phone for changes in the standard & poor's 500 index that would affect his options bets. ""mr. caspersen's criminal conduct cannot be excused,"" wrote shechtman in a sentencing memo. ""but it should not result in a life-destructive sentence at a time he is finding his way back to health."" caspersen fought back tears as he addressed the court before being sentenced. ""i have committed serious crimes of fraud, and have no one to blame but myself,"" he said. ""i stand before you asking for mercy."" rakoff's essay signaled he might consider a scientific explanation that might help explain the crimes. ""cognitive neuroscience ... holds out the promise of helping us to perceive, decide, and explain how intentions are arrived at and carried out,"" the judge wrote. after more than an hour of testimony and questioning of potenza, rakoff said he deemed it ""more likely than not"" that gambling addiction existed and could be a mitigating factor. still, he stressed it must be weighed with other factors in the case. ""it was a substantial fraud,"" said the judge. ""it was a fraud that involved the deception of people who had a lot of faith in the defendant."" ultimately, rakoff sentenced caspersen to four years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, and nearly $28 million in restitution. ""no purpose would be served by having him rot in prison for years on end,"" said the judge. he characterized federal sentencing guidelines that would allow the far longer sentence sought by prosecutors as ""absurd."" and, referring to the likelihood that some might question the leniency, rakoff said outsiders didn't know all the facts of the case. all caspersen could hope for was a judge who would seriously consider all of the arguments, shechtman told reporters afterward",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Fraud sentencing turns emotional; Defendant weeps as court debates gambling addiction,11/7/16
" it's a mid-october morning and the two-time oscar winner (life of pi, brokeback mountain) just premiered his latest film, billy lynn's long halftime walk, at new york film festival the night before. initial reviews were mixed for the ambitious wartime drama (53% on review aggregate site rottentomatoes.com), largely because of the way the film was presented: in 3-d, 4k resolution and 120 frames per second (five times faster than the average movie and the first studio film to be shot entirely at that  frame rate). ""the split is good news for me,"" says lee, who is warm and measured sitting in a hotel room with british newcomer joe alwyn, who plays titular soldier billy lynn. the hyper-real visuals are ""a lot to absorb; it's not a universally pleasing movie. if it doesn't split, there's something wrong with it."" pushback is inevitable ""whenever you push boundaries and challenge things,"" alwyn adds. ""nobody has seen anything like this."" billy lynn (opens in new york and los angeles friday; expands nationwide nov. 18) follows a 19-year-old army specialist and texas native (alwyn) as he returns home from iraq for a two-week victory tour in 2004, which culminates in a splashy halftime tribute at a dallas cowboys thanksgiving game. labeled a hero by well-wishers and the media after  trying to save his  comrade (vin diesel) who is killed in action, billy finds his allegiances torn between his fellow soldiers, who are set to return to iraq right after the game, and his sister (kristen stewart), who urges him to stay behind and seek help for his ptsd. writing the 2012 novel on which it's based, ""i was just trying to figure out why things are the way they are and why everyday life in america feels so completely insane,"" author ben fountain says. he was drawn to the idea of ""soldiers who have experienced this  ultimate reality of life and death, and then they get dropped back into mainstream american society. just the emotional and psychological whipsaw of that -- that's what i wanted to explore."" after winning his second best-director oscar in 2013 for the visually arresting life of pi, also adapted from a seemingly ""unfilmable"" best-selling novel, lee was looking to up the ante with his next project. unable to get his 3-d muhammad ali-joe frazier  boxing movie off the ground, he read billy lynn and was  hooked by its cinematic possibilities, particularly in its battle scenes and halftime show. ""i joked that i wanted it to be the biggest musical number since the producers,"" lee says of the performance, which arrives midway through the film. the eye-popping sequence is shot almost entirely from billy's perspective as he and members of the bravo company squad march onto the field with girl group destiny's child (played by stand-ins of all three members, including beyoncí©). ""it's very carefully choreographed. we rehearsed a lot"" and shot the 10-minute walk over four nights of the 48-day shoot. but even more than the giant set pieces, lee was drawn to the poignant coming-of-age story at billy lynn's heart as the timid soldier grapples with people's expectations of and for him. ""i very much identify with billy,"" says lee, 62, who was born and raised in cold war-era taiwan and completed mandatory two-year military service as a young man. ""patriotism is what i grew up with; i had my own growing-up experience. fortunately not as bad as billy's -- i never went to war -- but i can associate with what he's going through."" casting alwyn, who makes his feature-film debut with billy lynn, lee was drawn to the 25-year-old actor's soulfulness and ""all-american"" looks. ""a minute or two into the first scene, it was pretty obvious,"" lee says. but ""he was a little skinny back then -- i knew we had to beef him up."" alwyn endured a two-week boot camp in atlanta run by veterans, where he lived in barracks with seven of his co-stars with no access to technology. ""that was incredibly intense and tough, but also very eye-opening and really brought us together as a group,"" alwyn says. ""it wasn't just about learning the tactics of it all and how to use the weapons, it was about psychologically bringing us together as a bunch of brothers, which was so important to the story."" alwyn ""didn't complain and just  put up with the work,"" says garrett hedlund, who plays billy's wisecracking comrade sgt. david dime. even when they were awoken at 2 a.m. to do 200 push-ups, ""he just sucked it up."" throughout shooting, alwyn also spoke to veterans such as the film's military adviser, mark wachter, who served in iraq and spoke candidly about his struggle to readjust  to civilian life and why he enlisted.

""whether you're pro-war or anti-war, (the movie) brings it to a very human level."" billy lynn's patriotic themes could play well in the heartland with conservative moviegoers, although it's unlikely it'll reach the heights of other recent hits about the iraq war, such as american sniper ($350.1 million) or lone survivor ($125.1 million). daniel loria, editorial director at tracking site box office media,  predicts the movie will open in wide release with $18 million and finish off around $75 million, if audiences aren't turned off by its jarring visuals (called ""crisp,"" ""fake"" and ""distracting"" by critics).

""it's one thing to (have) slightly muted praise, but it got kind of beat up,"" davis says. ""it's a tough place to be in for the film, because i'm sure there are going to be people who respect the ambition of it. ...  and ang lee has always been (an esteemed) director, so even when he misses íæ la hulk or taking woodstock, there is some type of respect that comes with it, like, 'it was a slight misstep. he'll come back from it next time.'"" lee is taking criticisms of billy lynn in stride. he has since prepared other versions of the film to be shown in its nationwide release, since only two theaters in the country (new york's amc lincoln square and los angeles' arclight hollywood) are equipped to show it in its intended format. he says he plans to continue working in the accelerated frame rate and hopes moviegoers will go in with open minds.

" whether she was visiting her favorite travel blog or a booking site, a colorful image for a five-star hotel in chicago popped up, ""almost taunting me to click it,"" says wolko, a former corporate travel manager who lives in philadelphia. wolko's experience is common and has been for years. ""retargeting"" ads, as they're called, are an effective sales technique, particularly in travel. but what you might not know is how sophisticated these campaigns have become. as advertisers develop new ways to zero in on your wallet, consumers who want to preserve their privacy will need to find new tools to detect them and, if necessary, counter them. like a lot of targets, wolko hesitated. she knew the hotel and thought she couldn't afford it. but the banners kept appearing. she finally relented and followed the link. surprisingly, the luxury hotel offered a rate she could afford -- three nights for the price of two -- and she booked. ""normally, i'm not a fan of the ads that follow me,"" she says. ""but in this case, it worked out really well."" here's how a company retargets you: when you visit a website, the company attaches a cookie -- a snippet of identifying code -- that follows you around the internet. ""as you surf the internet, the code will inform the company of your presence on the web, and the company's programs then send an advertisement to you,"" explains george haley, who directs the center for international industry competitiveness at the university of new haven. most surveys suggest about half of all ads use retargeting. but now there's a new twist on these intelligent banners. instead of basing the ads on previous web behavior, they combine your online behavior with offline information. these are referred to as ""dynamic creative ads."" the upgraded ads could include the destination that you searched for -- even if you never typed it into your computer -- as well as flights or hotels in a similar price range, location and category. a little unnerving, isn't it? but maziar sattari, a vice president of product management for rocket fuel, a company that creates these dynamic ads, says companies go to great lengths to protect your privacy when they generate these ads. ""the travel company passes anonymous identifiers that correspond to the consumer's device, and their activity when they visited the travel site,"" he explains. rocket fuel then creates the ad using anonymous information to identify other users across the web on a variety of devices. so even though the ad looks like it was made just for you, it really is just made for someone just like you. still, the level of sophistication can seem shocking to the average user. peter cloutier, the chief marketing officer at catapult, a conversion marketing agency, says the most advanced companies have developed ""unique ids"" for every adult in the united states. they're even able to identify you down to the device. ""if you tend to do your buying while sitting in bed with a tablet, that's the device to which a 'buy' message is sent,"" he says. ""if you tend to do your longer content reading on your desktop, that's the device that will get the 'learn more' invitation."" the benefits to advertisers are undeniable. retargeting ads are more than twice as effective as normal ads, and in some cases far more. it can help you, too, by showing you a purchase you're likely to want to make. you might also land a better price on the airfare or hotel rate. but not always, critics warn. the search data you offer can be used by companies, particularly airlines, to gauge demand for a product, haley says. and that could lead to higher fares. plus, there's the undeniable irritant of having the same ad flash in your face over and over, just like it did for wolko. while the displays are smarter than ever, they're often tactless. it's a lot like shopping for a used car and telling a pushy salesman you're not interested in buying one of his cars, says james ward, executive creative director at saturday brand communications. ""then that salesman follows you home, pesters you at your house, shows up at your work, your family events -- everywhere you go, in an effort to keep trying to get you to buy a car,"" he says. ""not a very desirable customer experience."" like it or not, these advertising techniques are completely legal. but if the ads really bother you, there's one foolproof solution: ignore them. elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for national geographic traveler. contact him at chris@elliott.org or visit elliott.org. tools to counter retargeting use an ad blocker. ""a lot of consumers hate online ads,"" says nedim talovic, the co-founder of jellymetrics, an email marketing company. consider eliminating them. adblock plus (adblockplus.org), a plug-in that works with several popular browsers, is a popular choice. after all, you can't target what you can't see. opt out. some retargeted ads allow you to stop the retargeting by clicking on an icon within the banner, says victor wong, ceo of thunder, an advertising technology company. ""consumers can opt out of receiving retargeted ads by pressing that triangle icon at the top right of the ads,"" he says. browse anonymously.

" kohlhepp, 45, once threatened to kill his mother, used a hammer to destroy his newly remodeled bedroom, poured bleach into a goldfish bowl and locked a boy in a dog cage and rolled him around. kohlhepp now is suspected in the deaths of as many as seven people, spartanburg county sheriff chuck wright said, including charles david carver, 32, the boyfriend of kala brown, 30, who authorities discovered chained in a metal storage shed on kohlhepp's property in woodruff, s.c., last week. kohlhepp has not been charged in carver's death, but he was charged sunday in the deaths of four people in 2003. investigators unearthed a body sunday from a wooded section of kohlhepp's 95-acre property near woodruff. authorities have been scouring the property since thursday after finding kala brown, 30, of anderson, s.c.,  on the partially wooded site. kohlhepp, of moore, s.c., was charged earlier sunday in connection with the deaths of four people at the superbike motorsports shop in chesnee, s.c., in 2003: scott ponder, 30; his 52-year-old mother and part-time employee, beverly guy; and employees brian lucas, 29, and chris sherbert, 26. authorities say kohlhepp has confessed to the killings. the brutal quadruple slaying occurred two years after kohlhepp's release from prison, where he spent 15 years for the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl in tempe, ariz. after being charged as an adult in the 1986 rape, which took place when he was 15, kohlhepp pleaded guilty to a lesser crime. one neighbor in a 1987 pre-sentencing report described him as ""a devil on a chain."" as part of the plea bargain, kohlhepp's record would reflect he pleaded guilty to kidnapping, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender. ""approximately six years of intervention in 15 years of life have resulted in abysmal failure,"" judge c. kimball rose wrote in transferring kohlhepp's case to adult court. twenty years later, kohlhepp applied for a real estate license in south carolina, knowing his conviction and status as a sex offender would need to be explained. in that document, he called his victim his ""girlfriend,"" lied about his crime and did not include all the information about his charges and sentence.  he said he was charged with kidnapping because he happened to be carrying a firearm that he didn't know how to use but flashed at his girlfriend. he contended that arizona authorities were coming down hard on minors with firearms because of heavy gang activity at the time. he never mentioned that he served time in prison from 1987 to 2001 after he ""told her not to move while we talked this out."" hundreds of pages of court records, including a pre-sentencing report, psychological evaluations and statements from police, probation officers and judges in the 1986 case portray kohlhepp as an emotionally disturbed 15-year-old with anger issues, no family support system and little remorse for his crime at the time. in reality, kohlhepp used his father's handgun to force a 14-year-old neighbor to walk to his home, where he placed duct tape on her in his bedroom, tied her hands and then raped her, according to arizona records. when questioned about the crime, kohlhepp told a probation officer that he wasn't sure why he raped the girl but it could have been an act of rebellion because his father was out of town, the records show. he said the gun did not work. he said he also used a knife to threaten the teenage girl after placing the gun back where he found it, according to the records. while kohlhepp told the officer he knew what he did was wrong, he said he thought the girl was 16 at the time, so he considered a 15-year sentence for the rape unfair. he wanted his sentence to be 12 years or fewer because he thought getting out of prison at 28 would allow him to get a job in the military, according to the pre-sentencing report. the girl's rape had a ""devastating effect on the entire family,"" her parents said at the time. kohlhepp was a ""violent and vicious person"" who shined a knife in the girl's face during the assault, they said in the records. the 15-year-old kohlhepp was an only child whose parents had divorced when he was 1 or 2, according to the records. ""he is not a bad boy"" even though the crime was wrong, his mother said in a letter to the court. because her son walked his victim home after he raped her, ""does that sound like a dangerous criminal?"" she asked. but she informed a probation officer that he was repeatedly mean to other children growing up, and both parents talked of his explosive anger. contributing: mike ellis, independent-mail in anderson, s",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,S.C. man called 'devil on a chain' in 1986 rape case; Court records reveal a long history of emotional problems and anger issues,11/7/16

""wong at his worst in comics is a dated stereotype, the obedient chinese manservant, and there's so much more possibility in him,"" says screenwriter jon spaihts.

""i am betting that tomorrow you will reject fear and you'll choose hope."" clinton was given a final boost by the obamas as the president's approval ratings hit a record high. she entered the campaign's final day before americans go to the polls aiming to strike a positive note following a sharply divisive election season, emphasizing that she wants ""to be the president for everybody.""

""most of the people saying this stuff don't really believe it,"" he said, adding that many of her gop antagonists lauded clinton when she was secretary of state. clinton's final day on the campaign trail came one day after fbi director james comey sent a letter to congress announcing that the bureau's last-minute review of emails related to its investigation of her private server had concluded with no change in its recommendation against criminal charges. following that announcement, her pivot toward a more positive message became more pronounced. instead of spending the bulk of her stump speeches attacking trump, clinton's emphasis focused more on her plans for green energy, infrastructure jobs, what she's calling the biggest jobs investment since world war ii, and college affordability. ""my faith in our future has never been stronger,"" clinton told supporters in cleveland on sunday. in her monday speeches, clinton repeatedly called for more ""love and kindness"" in america.

" every four years, spending in presidential races soars to new heights. until now. a new estimate from the non-partisan center for responsive politics predicts the final price tag of the 2016 white house campaign will hit about $2.65 billion, a dip from the $2.76 billion that flowed into the 2012 contest, when adjusted for inflation. broadcast tv advertising to shape the 2016 white house contest has tumbled from four years ago, a byproduct of republican nominee donald trump's decision to rely more on free media coverage, digital outreach and his own prolific tweeting than traditional advertising to promote his candidacy. from june 8 to oct. 30, for instance, trump aired more than 68,000 ads to boost his white house ambitions, a striking drop from the roughly 182,000 ads that 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney aired on broadcast tv, national networks and national cable during the same period in that election, an analysis by the wesleyan media project shows. ""it's just apples and oranges to compare trump to any other major-party nominee,"" said shelia krumholz, who runs the center for responsive politics, which tracks campaign spending.

" rarely has ambition, in such different forms, taken such different routes toward the white house. here, for each candidate, are five defining moments that occurred before most americans got to know them -- clinton before the white house and the state department, trump before atlantic city and the apprentice. donald j. trump (born june 14, 1946) military discipline by the time he was 13, donald trump was ""a pretty rough fellow,'' his father, fred, admitted. the boy was variously described as bullying, rambunctious and rebellious. ""i always loved to fight,'' he told biographer michael d'antonio. he said he gave a teacher in elementary school a black eye. in 1959, trump was enrolled in the new york military academy, a boarding school in the hudson valley that was both strict (students wore uniforms) and lax (hazing was common). trump told d'antonio that when he sassed one instructor -- a world war ii vet -- he got roughed up. ""it was not like what happens today,'' he recalled. ""you had to learn to survive.'' trump thrived. in this presidential campaign, when his vietnam war deferments and military experience became an issue, he cited high school as his military experience. it gave him, he said, ""more training militarily than a lot of guys that go into the military.'' turnaround fred trump was a big new york developer and landlord. in 1962, he bought swifton village, a mostly vacant apartment complex in cincinnati at a foreclosure auction for $5.7 million. donald, a college student, would later write in the art of the deal that he spotted the opportunity himself: ""while my friends were reading the comics and the sports pages, i was reading the listings of fha (federal housing administration) foreclosures."" the trumps spent $500,000 to upgrade the complex, and within a few years, the vacancy rate was near zero. donald spent time on site; how much is in dispute. in a letter to the cincinnati enquirer in 2003, he said he ""lived in cincinnati and worked in the complex for two summers, fixing it both physically and financially."" a longtime swifton village maintenance man told the newspaper in 1990 that donald would fly in and stay for only a few days at a time, helping with tasks such as landscaping. a trump biographer, gwenda blair, says the project was far more fred's than donald's. the trumps sold in 1972 for $6.75 million, at ""a tremendous profit,"" donald said. in his book, he called it his first multimillion-dollar deal. art of the deal, act i by the mid-1970s, the once-elegant commodore hotel next to grand central terminal was a failing business in a nearly bankrupt city. donald trump saw a solid building in a peerless location in a world city on the rebound. he obtained an option to buy the hotel from a bankruptcy trustee; interested hyatt hotels in operating it; used political connections to help secure generous tax breaks (the first ever given a commercial project in new york); persuaded banks to loan money and his father to put up the rest. then the real work began -- shoring up the building's structure, constructing a lobby and sheathing the faade in glass. the cost ballooned by tens of millions, but the grand hyatt was a success from the day it opened in 1980. fred trump's real estate empire was in unfashionable areas of brooklyn and queens. donald had made it in manhattan, and he had set the stage for his most ambitious construction project: trump tower. springtime is for losers the u.s. football league was founded on the idea that americans were so crazy about pro football they'd even watch it in the spring. the league's first year, 1983, was fairly successful. trump, owner of the new jersey generals, pushed a different idea: if god wanted football in the spring, he wouldn't have created baseball. trump wanted to play in the fall, head to head with the nfl. some usfl owners doubted they could prevail against the mighty nfl. others, desperate over big losses from bidding wars with the nfl for players (which trump fueled), backed trump. before the 1985 spring season, the league announced that the 1986 season would be played in the fall. then it filed a $1.32 billion antitrust suit, claiming the nfl froze the usfl out of tv contracts and stadiums. the real goal: force a merger. the trial resulted in a jury verdict for the usfl -- and damages of $3. trump, the only usfl owner the league's lawyer (handpicked by trump) put on the stand, was an unsympathetic witness. it seemed less like big guy vs. little guy than fat cat vs. fat cat. less than a week later, the usfl suspended the fall season. it never played another game. for trump, the usfl was another step toward national celebrity. it proved his willingness to take on established interests, be it the nfl or the gop. public servant central park's wollman skating rink was closed by the city in 1980 for a three-year renovation. in 1986, it was still closed. enter trump. he offered to fix, quickly and cheaply, what he called ""the greatest embarrassment'' of mayor ed koch's administration. koch agreed. unbound by rules and restrictions that governed the city, trump finished the job in three months for less than $2 million, about $750,000 under budget. (the contractor, eager for future trump work, did the job at cost.) for trump, the real payoff was publicity. he staged a reopening ceremony featuring skating stars such as peggy fleming and the ice dancing team torvill and dean that was unlike any ""in the history of ice skating,"" he told a biographer, timothy o'brien. ""there are moments in life that are so good, you can never duplicate them."" trump showed that a businessman -- him in particular -- could succeed where politicians and public officials had failed. hillary rodham clinton (born oct. 26, 1947) astro-naught in 1961, excited about america's race to the moon, hillary rodham wrote to nasa, expressing interest in becoming an astronaut. sorry, the space agency replied, astronauts had to be male. the story fits the narrative of hillary as a lifelong gender pioneer, and she has told it for years. some people, not all clinton haters, are skeptical that nasa -- famously obsessed with pr -- would deliver so categorical a rebuff. no copy of the letter has been found, and there's no evidence nasa routinely replied to such queries with such candor. but in september 1961, the agency quietly terminated a program to screen potential female astronauts for the risky missions (possibly because the military didn't allow women to fly in combat). after studying the issue in depth, the washington post concluded this year that there's no reason to disbelieve clinton's story. commencement no student ever spoke at a wellesley college graduation until 1969, when, by senior class demand, student body president hillary rodham took the stage. it had been a tumultuous period, including the murders of martin luther king and robert kennedy the year before and the ongoing trauma of the vietnam war. ruth adams, wellesley's starchy president, was against a student speaker. after learning it would be rodham, she relented. although the graduate had worked all night on her speech, she focused on the remarks of the commencement speaker, edward brooke, a moderate republican and the only african american in the u.s. senate. brooke didn't mention king, kennedy or the war. he expressed ""empathy"" with demonstrators' goals while rejecting ""coercive protest."" ""the problem with empathy,"" rodham countered, ""is it doesn't do us anything. ... our leaders have used politics as the art of the possible. and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible."" emotional, electrifying and at times incoherent, clinton's speech captured a moment when, as she put it, ""we're searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living."" some parents and administrators were aghast, but rodham's classmates gave her a seven-minute standing ovation. the next week life magazine ran excerpts from the speech and a photo of the speaker. as hillary clinton wrote in her autobiography, living history, ""the accolades and the attacks turned out to be a preview of things to come."" commitment in 1971, during her second year at yale law school, rodham accepted a summer job with a left-wing firm in oakland. bill clinton, her fellow student and boyfriend of several months, had been offered a summer job organizing in the south for george mcgovern's fledgling presidential campaign. he surprised her by saying he was turning down mcgovern to go west with her. ""i tried to let the news sink in,"" she recalled in living history. ""i was thrilled. ""'why,' i asked, 'do you want to give up the opportunity to do something you love to follow me to california?' ""'for someone i love, that's why,' he replied."" she would make many professional and personal compromises over the years for him; that summer, he accommodated her. when they returned to new haven that fall, they moved in together. four years later, they'd enter into one of the most epochal of political marriages. health care, act i in 1979, the new governor of arkansas tapped his wife to lead a new rural health advisory committee, even though she admittedly knew little about health care or rural areas. the issue was a minefield; country doctors already had rebelled against attempts to expand medical care by using non-physicians. hillary rodham (still using her maiden name) solved the problem partly by using her connections to tap federal funds for a series of health clinics in the state's poorest counties. she was so successful that clinton subsequently appointed her to head a similar effort to improve education in the state. the clintons have touted the education effort ever since. the health panel was an earlier sign that she'd be her husband's partner not just in politics but in governing and that she'd have the health care portfolio. in her autobiography, hillary wrote that her arkansas experience ""made me excited and hopeful"" when president clinton named her to chair his health policy initiative in 1993. washington was different, and she failed. ""i didn't fully realize the magnitude of what we were undertaking. my work in arkansas ... didn't rival the scale of health care reform."" in sam's club all 15 walmart corporate directors were men. by 1986, that had become an embarrassment to the founding walton family. so sam walton turned to a woman who was not only the first female partner at little rock's powerhouse rose law firm but the governor's wife. as a board member, hillary rodham clinton (she'd added the last name) picked her spots. she fought for causes close to her heart (equal opportunity for women and environmentally responsible business practices), and she let some issues slide, notably walmart's hostility to unions. after she'd left the board and walmart came under increasing criticism from liberals, she rarely discussed her role at the company -- an illustration of her penchant for downplaying potentially controversial or unflattering history. in 2005, a walmart political action committee gave clinton's senate campaign $5,000",NEWS; Pg. 8A,USA TODAY,Clinton and Trump; 10 EARLY DEFINING MOMENTS,11/8/16

" the trump campaign is counting on that. for months, they've encouraged talk about donald trump's secret weapon, his ace in the hole. one might even call it trump's trump card: the ""hidden"" trump voter. such voters certainly exist, but it may turn out that they're outnumbered by the hidden hillary vote. first, let's look at the case for trump. it's true that pollsters have found that there are ""shy trump"" voters. shy voters -- a term borrowed from the british, to describe ""shy tories"" -- are people too embarrassed to tell pollsters their real preference. ""donald trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election,"" trump's campaign manager kellyanne conway has said.  ""it's become socially desirable, especially if you're a college-educated person ... to say that you're against donald trump."" an unlikely tsunami that was probably true in the  primaries. the problem  is that republican primary voters aren't a statistically representative sample of the whole country. the voters who tend to be squeamish about admitting to prefer trump tend to be affluent college-educated whites. the share of these voters in the electorate isn't large enough to sway the final tally as much as the trump campaign would like, particularly because many no doubt live in blue states -- california, new york, washington and illinois -- where trump will lose regardless. (though it does seem that the recent tightening in the polls is largely attributable to many of these voters.) trump supporters say there's another hidden trump vote: the legions of white ""low propensity"" voters pollsters fail to contact. if trump can activate this hidden army of voters, the theory holds, make way for the tsunami. political scientist william  frey looked at this scenario and found that if the white working class turned out in historically unprecedented and massive numbers, trump would win the popular vote by 0.3%, or 500,000 votes. there are many reasons to doubt that this scenario comes to pass. perhaps chief among them is the fact that to get that many new, low-propensity voters to the polls would likely require a massive ground operation. trump has nothing of the sort. even so, it's theoretically possible, and in some states early voting by whites is quite high. 'hidden' gop women however, such models assume that the rest of the electorate holds constant. that doesn't appear to be happening. to trump's benefit, african-american turnout appears to be falling somewhat short in early voting. on the flip side, latinos are breaking records in republican must-win states such as florida, georgia and north carolina, as well as the crucial state of nevada. there's also  anecdotal evidence that there are in fact ""hidden clinton"" voters among married republican women. in florida, at the beginning of early voting, turnout among hispanics was up 99% over the same period in 2012. in crucial clark county, nev., a surge in latino votes yielded the democrats a 72,000-ballot lead in early voting. clinton leads  trump among hispanics by more than 3-to-1 in polls. trump's lead among whites, though substantial, is much narrower, largely because he's losing among white college-educated voters and white women. early voting numbers aren't a statistically representative sample of the electorate, in part because early voting tends to cannibalize the most likely and most partisan voters. just as polling doesn't capture many of the ""hidden"" white voters, it's also notoriously bad at reaching young people and minorities (partly because of disparities in cellphone vs. land-line usage as well as language barriers). all of this points to the fact that no one really knows what the electorate will look like until after tuesday. but in an election full of  departures from the norm, there's a certain symmetry in the possibility that trump will indeed activate a lot of hidden whites, only to be undone by hidden hispanics. he began his campaign by recklessly disparaging hispanic immigrants. that approach, if not necessarily that specific rhetoric, helped him excite a core group of whites and, it seems, a core group of hispanics. we'll soon know whether it was worth the price",NEWS; Pg. 7A,USA TODAY,Clinton's Hidden voters; Trump's Election Day bet on a wave of 'shy' voters looks like a risky one,11/8/16
" in the coming hours, americans will have a better sense of how this year's election might affect their pocketbooks. usa today asked experts how election outcomes might affect them on a host of pocketbook issues. here's what we learned. minimum wage under president hillary clinton, the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour -- unchanged since 2007 -- would rise to $12 per hour over several years. that increase would have a mixed effect on low-wage and/or part-time workers, with some enjoying higher wages, while others might find themselves priced out of their jobs, according to an s&p capital iq report. according to carmel martin, executive vp for policy at the center for american progress action fund, one in four workers would see an average increase of $2,300 per year in wages, and minimum-wage workers would see an increase of $9,500 per year. the number of people living in poverty would fall by 4.5 million. under president donald trump, the minimum wage might rise to $10 an hour, or the decision to raise minimum wages would be left to the states. in short, some workers -- those in states that have raised or plan to raise the minimum wage -- would see somewhat of a boost, while the rest would see little or no change in their standard of living. taxes under president clinton, millionaires would pay more in taxes and the rest would pay about the same or less. her plan would levy a 4% surtax on those with adjusted gross incomes above $5 million and set a 30% minimum tax on those with agis topping $1 million (the so-called buffett rule). in addition, estates worth $1 billion or more would face a 65% estate tax. on the other hand, anyone making less than $250,000 wouldn't see any tax increases, according to bob williams, senior fellow at the urban-brookings tax policy center at the urban institute. and low- and middle-income households would get tax cuts thanks to expanded tax credits. president trump would significantly reduce marginal tax rates, increase standard deduction amounts, repeal personal exemptions and cap itemized deductions, according to williams. his proposal would cut taxes at all income levels, although the largest benefits, in dollar and percentage terms, would go to the richest households, according to the tax policy center (tpc). according to tpc's analysis of his tax plan, on average, households would see their tax bills go down. but some taxpayers, especially single parents, would see higher taxes. your bottom line: to calculate the effect of either candidate on your own taxes, check out the tax policy center's online calculator at http://tpc-election-calculator.urban.org/. student loans under president clinton, borrowers would never have to pay more than 10% of their incomes toward student debt, and all college debt would be forgiven after 20 years. in addition, clinton wants to make state and community colleges tuition-free for families earning up to $125,000; that would save the average family $9,410 per year, or $37,640 over four years, according to martin. president trump would cap repayments at 12.5% of a borrower's income and if borrowers make repayments for 15 years, he would forgive the rest of the debt, according to third way. trump does not offer a plan to make college affordable, according to martin. paid family and  medical leave under president clinton, there would be guaranteed paid family and medical leave up to 12 weeks where workers get at least two-thirds of their wages, according to third way. this plan applies to applies to men and women whether they become parents through surrogates, pregnancy or adoption. president trump would guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave, worth an average of $300 weekly. however, there's no relief for adoptive parents, fathers or caregivers who might be taking care of other family members who are ill, martin says. child care expenses president clinton would let families take their child care costs off their tax bills, to the tune of up to 10% of their incomes. plus, she would double the child tax credit to a maximum of $2,000 for young children, according to third way. president trump would let working parents deduct child care expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents. he would also establish dependent care savings accounts. social security under president clinton, high-income americans would pay more of their income above the current social security earnings cap into social security. for 2017, the maximum taxable earnings amount is $127,200, but under clinton that would rise toward $200,000. in addition, a president clinton would seek to increase benefits for widows and potentially other high-needs retirees, fight attempts to privatize social security, oppose reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments and oppose efforts to raise the retirement age, according to third way. for his part, a president trump has proposed no cuts to benefits in social security right now, but he might revisit the issue at a later time, according to third way. martin suggested that a proposed 13.5% across-the-board cut in federal spending would result in a cut to social security that would reduce the average monthly benefit by $182, from $1,360 in 2017 to $1,177. robert powell is editor of retirement weekly and contributes regularly to usa today, ""the wall street journal"" and marketwatch",MONEY;

" each initiative illustrates how significant decisions on the production and consumption of energy in the u.s. are often made at the state level, especially with gridlock in washington over federal policies. in colorado, voters will decide whether to make it more difficult to amend the state's constitution, following recent unsuccessful attempts by opponents of hydraulic fracturing to restrict the process used to extract oil and natural gas from shale deposits. amendment 71 would require the approval of at least 55% of the votes cast to change colorado's constitution, instead of a simple majority, as well as the signatures of at least 2% of the registered voters in each of the state's 35 senate districts to put a proposal on the ballot. the colorado oil and gas industry has contributed heavily in support of the ""raise the bar"" initiative, following failed bids by environmentalists this year and in 2014 to put anti-fracking measures before state voters. but support for amendment 71 is broader than just oil and gas interests, including the state's democratic governor, john hickenlooper, who says changing colorado's constitution should be more difficult than it is now. meanwhile, voters in florida and nevada will face referenda arising from controversies over solar energy and the extent to which residents and businesses should be able to rely more on rooftop panels and less on their local utility. amendment 1 in florida would give residents a state constitutional right to own or lease solar equipment installed on their property to generate electricity for their own use, something that's already provided for under state law. but what makes the florida initiative especially controversial is another provision that would ensure that consumers who don't install solar equipment aren't required to subsidize the costs of backup power and grid access to those with solar panels. backed by investor-owned utilities such as florida power & light and duke energy, the referendum would invite state regulators to change or abandon so-called ""net-metering"" policies, which require utilities to provide credits to customers for solar power they produce but don't consume themselves, according to critics of the initiative. utilities in florida, nevada and other states maintain the net-metering policy is unfair to non-solar customers, including those in low-income neighborhoods who can't afford solar panels and end up paying more to maintain the local grid. opponents of the ballot item say it's a move to maintain the utilities' monopoly in the sunshine state by keeping out third-party providers of solar power. a similar debate is taking place in nevada, where an ""energy choice"" initiative would give customers the right to pick their power provider in an open retail market based on price, reliability and other factors, or produce their own electricity from solar and other renewable energy sources and sell any excess power on the open market. if approved by voters tuesday, the initiative would require passage a second time in 2018 before taking effect by 2023. supporters of nevada's energy-choice proposal include mgm resorts international, which is using existing law to sever ties to nv energy, the state's largest utility, and tesla, the electric-car maker which is building a major battery factory in the state. nv energy is remaining neutral on the initiative. of the several state energy-related referenda, the one that could have the most far-reaching implications is one in washington state that would apply a carbon tax to coal, natural gas and oil. initiative 732 is seen by many advocates of a carbon tax as a model for other states and perhaps the entire u.s. to lower emissions that contribute to global warming. backed by a campaign called carbon washington, the initiative is designed to be revenue-neutral, gradually increasing the carbon tax while reducing sales and other sales taxes. the levy would start at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in 2017 and rise to $100 per metric ton by mid-century. the washington measure is stirring  controversy, even among environmentalists, some of whom oppose it for failing to dedicate revenue to green energy technology and low-income consumers. bill loveless  is a veteran energy journalist and podcast host in washington",MONEY; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,Solar use among energy reform measures featured on state ballots,11/8/16

" hand-in-hand, miles from the nearest village, ""nothing and no one around them, they were out on the edge of the world."" the sight of the two girls joined together in the face of an otherwise empty existence tugs the narrator's thoughts back to her childhood in northwest london when she was irresistibly drawn to tracey,  the charismatic neighbor girl who became so meaningful to the narrator's life that she served almost as a double, a shadow. though it ranges over decades and across continents, swing time (penguin press, 453, ***1/2 out of four) is above all focused on that childhood friendship. the unnamed narrator is as sensitive and observant as tracey is courageous and assertive, and their bond is struck through with love and jealousy and admiration and contempt. they are two brown girls navigating a mostly white society, and their loyalty is sharpened by their shared feeling of being outsiders. when the friendship inevitably ruptures, the girls lose touch; tracey becomes a professional dancer while the narrator gets a gig as an assistant for aimee, a superstar recording artist whose overly ambitious passion projects include opening a school for girls in africa. smith (white teeth) is a master stylist, delivering revelatory sentences in prose that never once veers into showiness. though her sentences are tasteful, smith is always game for a pulpy plot turn -- after a stolid first hundred pages the storyline heats up into some high drama. the novel will demurely sidestep its most theatrical events, milking tension before revealing a major plot point through dialogue or retrospective narration. this is a soap opera for the discerning set. the gifted observer narrating swing time turns her incisive attention to wide-ranging targets, from white volunteerism in africa to children's tendency to lie to their parents to protect them from uncomfortable truths. through it all, a portrait emerges of an inveterate outsider who time and again attaches herself to shining stars, while always walling off her own true self. despite all the glamorous turns of her life, the narrator always feels like she's ""the only person still outside, looking in."" through this preoccupation, smith keeps returning the novel's focus to its foundations, the fascinating shadow-friendship of tracey and the narrator, in which the person rejected is also the one most deeply loved. even after years apart, after loves and careers are gained and lost, the narrator's thoughts regularly return to tracey.

""we can't say if they are male or female,"" said spartanburg county coroner rusty clevenger. they were found close to each other and were at the two sites that todd kohlhepp indicated on saturday. kohlhepp, 45, a real estate broker, pilot and convicted sex offender, was arrested and charged with kidnapping kala brown, 30, who was found thursday chained inside a storage building on the property. kohlhepp also has been charged with four counts of murder in the 2003 quadruple slayings at superbike motorsports in chesnee. clevenger said he will rely on examinations of the bodies to determine how they died and would not go into their state of decomposition. ""at this time we don't feel like there are any more bodies on this property,"" said lt. kevin bobo, spartanburg county sheriff's office spokesman. the majority of the property has been searched, but investigators will be back on the site tuesday, he said. kohlhepp initially refused to talk with investigators and asked for a lawyer, bobo said. on saturday, he ""re-initiated contact with us and confessed to the superbike murders,"" bobo said. ""we can't go into who the people are or if kohlhepp identified the two people found sunday and monday,"" bobo said. he has not confessed to any other killings, bobo said. on monday, a day after investigators unearthed a second body from a wooded section of kohlhepp's property, an excavator could be seen digging at a site separate from friday's and sunday's discovery of bodies as the painstaking search for more remains entered its fifth day. a green body board was taken onto the property monday afternoon. about an hour earlier, spartanburg county sheriff chuck wright gathered inside the fenced area with a group of people from duncan first baptist church for prayer. the sheriff and coronor, along with other investigators, could be seen working in the woods close to a clearing on the property. late in the afternoon, a piece of excavating equipment was removed from the scene as was some evidence put into a black bag and driven away in a truck. on saturday, kohlhepp pointed investigators to the location of the second body and another after he was allowed to see his mother, according to cbs. wright did not know when further charges might be brought against kohlhepp, but solicitor barry barnette said other charges are likely. the search for bodies has extended beyond the woodruff property to other locations linked to kohlhepp, though wright declined to say where. the investigation is widespread and no longer limited to south carolina, he said. just how far and for how long the search will continue is unclear, but since kohlhepp has had  a private pilot's license since 2006 and worked as a real estate broker in greenville and spartanburg who owned his own property management business, the search may prove vast. kohlhepp has yet to be charged in relation to the bodies that have now been found buried on his property. the remains of charles carver, 32, who was brown's boyfriend and had gone missing along with her in late august, were recovered friday. carver had been shot multiple times, clevenger said. wright said it is believed to be one of the two bodies the suspect told investigators about when he was brought to the scene saturday morning. neither wright nor clevenger would speculate on an identity, or whether kohlhepp had identified who might be in those graves. wright and clevenger declined to say whether the remains were skeletal or how long they may have been buried on the property, and would only classify them as ""human remains."" contributing: michael burns, nathaniel cary and eric connor, the greenville (s.c.) news; mike eads and frances parrish, anderson (s.c",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"Third body found on property owned by S.C. murder suspect; Questions persist as body count rises, investigation expands",11/8/16

" the early results surprised pollsters and rattled investors. dow futures plunged about 800 points, or 4.4%, as the markets worried about the uncertainty of a trump administration. a trump win would upend american politics with promises to roll back large parts of president obama's legacy. the billionaire real estate mogul has promised to build a wall on the mexican border, stop muslim refugees from entering the country and -- in a departure from longstanding american tradition -- send his election opponent to jail. from the beginning, trump's narrow road to victory wound through must-win swing states like florida, ohio and north carolina. trump won all of them, and then added georgia even as he maintained slight leads in blue states like michigan and wisconsin, putting him just one or two red states from the 270 electoral votes needed to win. with no political experience to his name, trump defied expectations throughout his unconventional campaign, vanquishing a crowded field of 16 other republicans for the chance to face clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state. the result was one of the most bitter campaigns in modern history, bringing phrases like ""basket of deplorables"" and ""nasty woman"" into daily conversation. despite the unpopularity of both candidates, turnout was up. in the 1,143 counties with 100% precincts reporting as of 10:45p.m.et, 5.6% more voters cast votes than in 2012. the race pitted two candidates with singular qualities: clinton, who would become the first female president after 228 years of men, against trump, whose vast wealth, lack of government experience and blunt rhetoric would redefine the word ""presidential."" his insult-laden speeches and tweets -- which his supporters defended as a refreshing break from political correctness -- were recounted in attack ads that flooded battleground states. even before the vote-casting turned to vote-counting, a sense of history hung over the day. many women wore pantsuits to the polls, an homage to clinton's conservative sartorial style. hundreds of women made a pilgrimage to a rochester, n.y., cemetery, affixing their ""i voted"" stickers to the headstone of susan b. anthony, the suffragist leader whose work paved the way for women'sright to vote. nearly a century later, gender issues were never far from the forefront of clinton's barrier-breaking campaign -- or from trump's. nearly two-thirds of voters who spoke to exit pollsters said they were bothered by clinton's use of a private email server.  even more said they were bothered by trump's treatment of women -- with more than half saying that his conduct bothered them ""a lot."" more than one-tenth of voters said they made up their minds on how to vote in the last few days of the campaign, as the fbi revealed its on-again, off-again investigations into clinton's emails. justin byerly of asheville, n.c., said his decision was difficult.

" his bluster was sure to turn off mainstream voters, and his incendiary language on immigrants would surely be seen as an a death wish in a country with a rapidly changing face. but trump managed to pull it off. in a nation deeply disillusioned by washington, contemptuous of elites and alienated by the decline in manufacturing jobs, he took his outsider label all the way to the white house in tuesday's election. one key to the new york businessman's win over hillary clinton was his staunchly anti-trade views, which resonated in rust belt states. in ohio, for instance, a state won by a republican for the first time since 2004, 47% of voters said they viewed trade as bad for jobs. and people with that view supported trump 2-to-1. trump was not this page's choice to be president. in fact, we considered him unfit for the presidency and expressed grave reservations about his ability to effectively manage the nation's affairs at home and abroad. that viewpoint was shared by investors worldwide. in the late night hours as his election became more and more likely, dow jones futures were down by 800 points. his election, after a divisive and mean-spirited campaign, will greatly complicate the united states' relations with its key allies. most dangerously, as commander in chief a president has few restraints on his power. giving an angry, combative man with a quick temper and an inability to ignore slights access to the nuclear codes is a frightening thought. so is trump's puzzling admiration for russian dictator vladimir putin. but trump is the person chosen by the american people. and, in a democracy, that is reason enough to accept the result without violence. those who opposed him should assume the role of loyal and constructive opposition. we trust that trump's worst instincts to pit one ethnic group against another will be restrained once he is forced into the delicate position of governing. the nation is, furthermore, blessed by its founding fathers with a system of checks and balances. it has an independent court system and a congress to restrain the more destructive, unconstitutional initiatives of a temperamental, ill-prepared president. he would, for instance, likely run up against a wall of opposition should he try to ban muslims from entering the country or prosecute clinton. even his plan for mass deportations of undocumented workers would be a hard sell in congress, as it would be hugely controversial and would greatly harm the republican party's future with immigrant voters. trump will soon find that many of his proposals are unworkable. in fact, many of them are not so much proposals as they are aspirations. he will not, for instance, be able to snap his fingers and bring back manufacturing jobs. his failure to deliver on his preposterous promises threatens to leave the voters who put him in the white house even more disillusioned about politics than they already are",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Trump's unexpected victory plunges U.S. into uncertainty,11/9/16

""" with the betrayal of that promise in a bipartisan budget deal just as the economy was heading into recession, bush gave us the pat buchanan rebellion, the ross perot boomlet and the two-fer presidency of billary clinton. then clinton's hillary-managed health care overreach gave us the 1994 angry white men election and the newt gingrich revolution. in donald trump's apparent victory tuesday, you can hear an echo of each of those events: anger at republican elites whom grass roots activists view as corrupt compromisers; a kooky business leader at the head of a movement powered by the heirs of the buchanan brigades; spurred by democratic health care overreach and enabled by the ethically compromised clinton family political machine. democrats didn't learn from their mistakes in the 1990s. neither did republicans' ruling mandarins. boy did we have this coming. and now i am afraid we are going to get it from a new republican president who once thought obamacare might be a good idea, opposed ronald reagan's tax cuts and defended bill clinton's approach to intern management. jill: what i see in trump's apparent victory is disgust at a gridlocked government and inside players like the clintons. the irony is the backlash doesn't seem aimed at president obama, whose favorable rating is 20 points higher than that of the gop. it's no accident that he was relatively new to the washington establishment and was in his own way something completely different. bush 41's mistake was in making the no-new-taxes vow, not in agreeing to the budget deal. that was the kind of leadership the country needed. it helped lead to surpluses instead of deficits, for pete's sake. it's the kind of ""grand compromise"" obama was trying to work out with john boehner when he was house speaker. instead of enforcing discipline for the good of the country, boehner coddled his tea party troops even as they retreated ever further into a fantasy world of believing they could impose their will on this big, thrillingly diverse country. the popular vote doesn't lie. al gore won it in 2000, and it was quite possible hillary clinton would win it in 2016. maybe it's time to get rid of the electoral college. it is definitely time to usher the clintons off-stage. it's been clear to me for years that she was at best a risk and at worst a non-starter. that was of course no deterrent to her. so even knowing that the private email server and her clinton foundation entanglements were ticking time bombs, she jumped right in. that was the signal for most other democrats to stay out -- and so there they were, clinton and her democrats, trapped on the island with nowhere to turn but each other. enough already. david: and that is the democratic party's big role in this electoral disaster tuesday night. democrats knew that hillary and bill clinton put their own interests above their country and didn't do much that i could see to call them on it. democrats knew that hillary and bill put their own ambitions above the needs of their political party, and still the party donors and political operatives united behind the clintons and now we are here. ""do we actually know who told hillary she could use a private email? and has that person been drawn and quartered?"" clinton friend neera tanden asked last year in a leaked wikileaks email to campaign chairman john podesta. tanden knew the disaster clinton was unleashing on her country and the doom in store for her party, and yet there she was day after day on msnbc, playing the good soldier, pretending that black was white and helping pave the way for donald trump to defile the oval office. the democratic party sure could have used some #nevertrumpers, but i couldn't name the folks who risked their careers and reputations to stop hillary and save our country from trump. jill: i have huge respect for the #nevertrumpers. i can't imagine where they go from here, but they tried to save their country. if trump governs as he campaigned, we are in for sex, lies, videotape and policy flip-flops that will set records. we have no idea what he really believes about most things. if he follows through on his promises, there are 20 million people who are on the verge of losing health insurance; 11 million people likely to be deported; an entire religion banned from entering america ""until we know what's going on""; military leaders, journalists and many others wondering if their incoming president will stick with the constitution or just decide to wing it; gob-smacked allies girding themselves to deal with a compulsive liar, and one leader sighing with content in russia. good job, vladimir putin and wikileaks. good job, republicans and democrats. good job, america. david mastio, a libertarian conservative, is the deputy editor of usa today's editorial page",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,"Congrats America.

" donald trump, the political novice who was taken seriously by almost no one when he announced his presidential campaign 16 months ago, challenged hillary clinton in battleground states tuesday night with a campaign that defied expectations of an early call in her favor. the most caustic presidential campaign in memory ended with deepened divides by gender, ethnicity and education -- and with new coalitions emerging for the two major parties that could reverberate in american politics for a generation. clinton's democratic coalition included overwhelming support from african-americans and a wide margin among newly energized latinos, plus the backing of most white college-educated women and the affluent -- voters that used to be republicans. trump's republican coalition was almost entirely white and included a crushing margin among men without a college education -- the sort of working-class men who used to be democrats. they were battling for votes in a nation that was divided and downbeat about their leaders and their lives. in exit-poll surveys by edison research, more than three in five voters said things in this country had gotten ""seriously off on the wrong track,"" and two-thirds said their personal financial situation hadn't improved or had gotten worse in the past four years. only a bit more than a third predicted that life for the next generation would be better than life today -- the fundamental tenet of the american dream. for the newly elected president, a political landscape shaped by invective is likely to be as challenging as any in decades. the most common reaction among trump supporters to the idea of clinton's election was ""scared"" -- which was also the most common reaction among hillary clinton supporters to the prospect of trump's election. only one voter in 50 viewed both candidates as trustworthy. nearly one in three voters said neither was. that's not exactly a prescription for a political honeymoon, or even for a respite from a year of partisan combat. historians and political scientists struggled to cite a precedent for a contest so defined by division and attack. the dominant message from each candidate was that the other couldn't be trusted with the keys to the white house. enthusiasm was in notably short supply: fewer than half of voters said they strongly favored their own candidate; four years ago, two-thirds had. ""you'd have to go back to burr-hamilton in the weehawken duel,"" said new york rep. steve israel, an eight-term long island democrat who is retiring. (history class reminder: in 1804, then-vice president aaron burr mortally wounded former treasury secretary alexander hamilton.) ""you'd almost have to say 1860,"" mused nicole hemmer, an assistant professor of presidential studies at the university of virginia. abraham lincoln won that election, but seven southern states moved to secede before he was inaugurated. ""the 1860 election happened and there was no willingness to accept the results, and that of course leads to the civil war. i don't think that's going to happen here, but the idea that a candidate might not accept the results, and that would be part of his big sell to the public, that's not something we've seen before."" trump's nomination alone had been groundbreaking. the bombastic real-estate mogul gained renown in the world of reality tv, not politics or government -- the first major-party candidate since world war ii to lack any experience in government or military command, and one often at odds with the establishment of the party he led. clinton's nomination was groundbreaking as well: the former secretary of state was the first woman nominated for president by a major party in the 240-year history of the republic. sixteen months ago, they launched their candidacies within days and a mile of one another, at trump tower and on roosevelt island. here's a look at what happened in their final showdown tuesday, and why. women roared maybe this shouldn't be a surprise: the campaign featuring the first female nominee -- and one running against a male opponent accused of sexual harassment -- was heading toward an historic gender gap. men backed trump by nine points; women backed clinton by 14, a wider margin than they had given barack obama four years ago. the exit polls indicated that the gender gap, the difference in support for a candidate between male and female voters, likely would surpass the record of 11 percentage points in the 1996 presidential campaign that re-elected bill clinton. close to six in 10 women said his treatment of women bothered them ""a lot;"" just over four in 10 men felt that way. a majority of college-educated women voted for the democratic candidate for the first time since at least 1952, when exit polls allowed demographics characteristics to be analyzed. but the key divisions tuesday weren't only about gender. they also were about education. white women who weren't college graduates? they backed trump by double digits. blue-collar whites turned red there was a time when white men without a college education -- men who worked with their hands, including those in unions -- were a backbone of the democratic coalition fdr forged. but this year, that group gave trump his most avid support, embracing his message that unwise trade deals and competition for jobs from illegal immigrants had cost them their place in the middle class. they backed him by close to 3-1. while clinton was endorsed by the leadership of most labor unions, voters from union households backed her only narrowly. latinos turned out almost two-thirds of latinos were supporting clinton -- or, perhaps, opposing trump for his harsh rhetoric about deporting illegal immigrants and a huge wall along the southern border",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Next leader will inherit division,11/9/16
" democrats needed to gain 30 seats to seize control of the house. that's an unlikely outcome, congress watchers agree. ""that would mean an unbelievable night,"" said barry burden, a professor of political science at the university of wisconsin-madison and director of its elections research center. at midnight, republicans had won 207 seats to 148 for democrats. it takes 218 to claim the majority. upsetting the republicans would have required a huge win on hillary clinton's part, on the order of a double-digit win for her to lift the rest of the party's candidates, burden said.  late tuesday, trump led clinton in several battleground states, all but eliminating the chance that she could sweep other democrats into office with her. the democrats' other dilemma: they received more votes overall nationally in 2014, but still lost seats -- largely because they ran up the score in safe districts. republicans will likely lose seats after tuesday's voting, burden said, in the range of 10 to 20. if they lose fewer than 10, that will indicate a good night for the gop, he said. if they lose more -- as many as 15 to 20, democrats should take heart. sarah binder, a senior fellow at the brookings institution and a political science professor at george washington university, agreed that a loss of fewer than 10 seats would be a net positive for republicans. david wasserman differed just a bit, putting his marker at 13 republican losses. if the democrats win more than 13, they should be pleased. if they win fewer, republicans can breathe easier, according to wasserman, house editor for the cook political report. in florida, republicans held on to two competitive seats, but lost one. in an open seat in eastern florida, including part of palm beach county, brian mast defeated democrat randy perkins after the democratic incumbent patrick murphy opted to run for the senate. murphy lost to republican sen. marco rubio. in another closely watched race, the incumbent republican carlos curbelo held off democrat joe garcia in south florida. but in the orlando area, democrat stephanie murphy beat 12-term incumbent john mica, a fixture in florida politics. the district boundaries were redrawn last year and held fewer republicans. also in florida's st. petersburg area, former governor charlie crist, a one-time republican and then independent who ran as a democrat in tuesday's election, helped the democrats pick up one seat in the house. crist beat republican incumbent david jolly. what's likely to be apparent on wednesday, burden said, is a smaller, more conservative majority as the gop's losses will probably come in suburban districts, home to more moderate republicans. the slimmer, more conservative majority will make it more difficult to re-elect house speaker paul ryan of wisconsin and to pass legislation, burden said. ryan, as expected, won his race. republicans, based on their campaign ads, have focused on local issues, binder said in an email. while democrats have attempted to ""nationalize"" races by linking republicans to donald trump. one of the more competitive races, burden said, simmers in wisconsin where republican rep. reid ribble, from the green bay area and a member of the 'never trump' club, is not seeking reelection. rep. barbara comstock, r-va., won an expensive race against her democratic challenger luann bennett in their suburban washington district. that race saw the two candidates saturate the airwaves with advertisements in the closing weeks of the race. comstock won the endorsement of the washington post. in new york, republican incumbent john katko, a freshman, held off a challenge from democrat colleen deacon in another closely watched race in the central part of the state. binder will also be watching the races of two republican incumbents on opposite coasts: scott garrett in new jersey and darrell issa in california",NEWS; Pg. 6A,USA TODAY,Republicans keep hold on the House; Caucus slightly smaller but more conservative,11/9/16

" but elation led to worry by evening, as gop presidential nominee donald trump challenged  democratic nominee hillary clinton in key swing states. when polls opened, the possibility of ending the night with two words -- madam president -- proved electric, and emotions ran the gamut from euphoria to tears. as clinton supporters hit the polls, some women (and men) voters wore white, a nod to the suffrage movement that afforded women the right to vote in 1920. in rochester, n.y., thousands of people, a large majority of them women and girls, queued up to visit the grave of women's rights crusader susan b. anthony, who famously cast a ballot in 1872 knowing it was illegal, and was subsequently arrested. born before she had the right to cast a ballot, ""i'd like to vote twice but that's not possible,"" said 100-year old florence thaler, a resident of pequannock township, n.j. at poll stations, women arrived with their mothers, daughters and sisters. many wore pantsuits as a nod to clinton's signature look. ""just high fived a #pantsuit wearing wearing stranger. this is a weird day,"" tweeted lucy arnold, whose bio identifies her as a teacher and writer. in columbia, s.c., consultant elizabeth wilson set a soundtrack to her day, playing beyoncí©'s run the world (girls) and fleetwood mac's don't stop on her instagram story-documented morning walk to her polling station. ""i was feeling excited, ecstatic, happy, lucky to be part of this historic moment,"" said wilson. ""the country as been ready, for a few decades, for a woman president."" but by tuesday night, twitter became a current of worry due to the razor-thin voting margins.

""this election and trump's language has brought up so many traumas for women and this is half the nation telling us, ""oh well,"" tweeted @alysemigran. in iowa, ruline steininger, 103, began her night watching cnn's early return, offering a stern ""good!"" after each state was  called for clinton. steininger cast her first vote for franklin d. roosevelt in 1940. starting with her annual christmas letter last year, she willed herself to live, writing to her friends and family she ""decided to stay alive to vote for hillary."" ""i thought it was great that a black man got elected for president,"" she said tuesday. ""i didn't think that would happen in my lifetime, but it did. now, it is high time for a woman, and this time we have a woman who is really capable of being president of the united states."" but when the network reported that trump was leading  -- at least temporarily -- in florida, she set  her tea down with emphasis. ""don't tell me that,"" she all but yelled at the tv. at dawn in rochester, the mood was jubilant and reflective. supporters continued the tradition of decorating suffragette susan b. anthony's headstone at mount hope cemetery with their ""i voted"" stickers. ""i'm voting for the first woman president. as a woman i can vote because of the sacrifices she made,"" said gillian paris of brighton, n.y., who affixed her sticker to anthony's marker shortly after sunrise.

""we'll have a real human being in the white house who understands the people,"" she predicted. eugene dunn, a long island limo driver who took his son out of school to attend trump's announcement 17 months ago at trump tower, said he had ""the champagne on ice"" as he awaited the verdict. ""no one i know says they're voting for hillary clinton,"" he said.

""i cannot see president obama turning over the government. i'm not being pessimistic, i'm being realistic."" as the votes were counted, the trump optimists and the trump pessimists shared one thing: relief that the campaign was over. jeff lau, 58, who owns a brew pub in york, pa., called it ""the ugliest i've ever seen."" he was hardly sanguine about what came next, regardless of whether his man won or lost, or whether the gop maintained control of the house and senate. ""donald is a little vindictive, and instead of negotiating he'll probably try to dictate to republicans in congress, who didn't really support him,"" lau said. ""they'll push back, and then we'll have gridlock."" trump supporters were torn between pondering the benefits of his election and the costs of his defeat. erwin jackson, a tallahassee, fla., landlord and real estate manager, said a clinton presidency would mean higher taxes and more regulation and could drive him into retirement: ""why work harder? it's just more stress. i'm 66. all four of my brothers have retired. my sons say, 'dad, you've worked all these years.'"" besides such personal concerns, many in trump nation feared for what a defeat would mean for the political process. the aforementioned quade, a 50-year-old real estate agent who lives in suburban indianapolis, said a trump loss would ""mean we're going to a one-party system. if we can't win against such a weak candidate, we have no chance of ever winning again."" trump himself had encouraged such an attitude the previous day, when he said there was no substitute for victory and no consolation in defeat. if he didn't win, he said at a rally in north carolina, ""we've all wasted our time."" he also told a crowd in sarasota, fla.: ""they say we'll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose. i said, 'no, no, no, no.' i don't want any credit if we lose."" he sounded an apocalyptic note. ""we will never have another opportunity."" many of his followers agreed.

" while the winner was still undetermined as this edition went to press, one thing remained clear: whoever comes out on top, it is imperative for the nation and its political leaders to honor the eventual outcome and address the issues of national importance. if trump eventually wins, he deserves to be accorded the respect of other presidents-elect. should clinton prevail, trump and his backers will gain little by raising unreasonable doubts about ""rigged"" results. as tuesday's nail-biting contests in a number of nations showed, america  is a deeply polarized nation. and trump's support, despite his huge flaws, reflects many voters' frustration with government's ability to improve their lives. but there is little indication that americans have much sympathy for sore losers. the united states has pressing needs that won't be addressed by pouting and infantile partisanship. while washington can't snap its fingers and bring back millions of low-skill factory jobs, it can and must refrain from making matters worse. in recent years, with the two parties at war with each other, the national debt has soared as the result of off-budget spending on retirement and health care. at the same time, government has vastly underspent on infrastructure and left key issues such as tax simplification and immigration reform languishing. if lawmakers and the next president were to actually address some of these issues, they could give a boost to the economy and lessen some of the anger directed their way. the early signs of this happening are, to be sure, not good. republicans retained their house majority on tuesday, and their caucus is increasingly under the control of hard-liners who favor government shutdowns and threats  to default on the national debt as ploys to gain leverage. democrats, meanwhile, have fallen more under the wing of populists such as sens. bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who push fanciful social spending proposals. whoever emerges as president needs to find ways to bridge these gaps, and the two parties will have to stop behaving like spoiled children and start acting on the people's behalf. early talk of impeaching the winning candidate will not do anything, either. house republicans tried impeachment in 1998, pursuing charges against then-president bill clinton despite widespread opposition from voters. the result: the gop vastly underperformed in that november's midterm elections, and clinton went on to enjoy high ratings in his final two years in the oval office. the american people are not  as petty as their politicians. every day they do innovative things and solve myriad problems while interacting across racial, ethnic, gender and generational lines. they solve their own problems without looking to washington for help",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,"Honor the outcome, and address the issues",11/9/16

" ""we're feeling buoyant,"" campaign manager kellyanne conway told fox news late tuesday. trump out-performed late polls, winning essential states like florida and north carolina. he also won ohio -- which had been expected -- and was running surprisingly strong in democratic-leaning  pennsylvania and michigan. ""let me tell you, if i don't win i will consider it a tremendous waste of time, energy and money,"" trump told fox & friends early tuesday, one of the two interviews he gave the  news outlet. the concession question asked if he would concede the election should he wind up losing, trump was noncommittal. ""we're going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it,"" trump told fox news in a later interview. ""we're going to see how they play out and i want to see everything honest."" trump also said he felt ""good"" about the election and that ""i think we are going to do very well."" but he made several suggestions through the day that the results would not be honest. as networks began calling states for both candidates, trump supporters streamed into a ballroom at the new york hilton in midtown for what they hoped would be a victory celebration. fans wearing red ""make america great again"" hats milled about a cash bar, some gawking at a giant ""victory cake"" in the shape of trump's head. supporters at the trump event cheered loudly when fox news anchor chris wallace said it is possible that trump could win. as trump continued to win critical states, his fans cheered. republican consultant hogan gidley attributed the surprise results to ""anger,"" particularly among struggling industrial workers in the rust belt. ""americans have been getting kicked in the gut,"" he said. gidley also said voters want change, and ""hillary clinton was the embodiment of the establishment and the embodiment of the status quo."" the new york businessman cast his vote tuesday morning at a school in manhattan, joking with reporters: ""tough decision."" voters at trump's polling place cheered his presence; others booed and yelled ""phony"" at the republican candidate.

""it's a great opportunity. there's tremendous enthusiasm you see it all over the country, all over the world. it's a great feeling."" lot of polls 'are phony' while pre-election surveys gave an edge to clinton, trump told fox news ""i think a lot of the polls are phony,"" and predicted victory. he also said his campaign is checking out reports of alleged problems at the polls, telling fox that ""it's happening at various places today, it has been reported."" throughout the final weeks of the campaign, trump warned about the prospect of a ""rigged"" election based on alleged voter fraud and biased news coverage. the republican nominee has consistently declined to say whether he would honor the results of the election if he loses. eric trump, the candidate's son, told msnbc that his father would respect the results, win or lose -- if he deems it a legitimate election. ""if he loses and it's legit and fair, and there's not obvious stuff out there then without question, yes,"" the younger trump said. in one radio interview, trump told talk show host howe carr that it was ""sad"" that  george w. bush opted not to vote for him, as a spokesman confirmed tuesday. ""i don't think it has any impact, frankly,"" trump said. trump, remained out sight most of tuesday, making calls, conducting interviews and using social media. throughout the day, he tweeted admonishments to voters to get to the polls. said one missive: ""don't let up, keep getting out to vote -- this election is far from over!"" election day capped an insurgent trump campaign that, in many ways, represented a near-hostile takeover of the republican party. supporters called trump a refreshing non-politician and described his language as an assault on ""political correctness."" critics called it racist and sexist. in one of his fox news interviews, trump said he ran the best campaign he could.

" the early results surprised pollsters and rattled investors. dow futures plunged about 800 points, or 4.4%, as the markets worried about the uncertainty of a trump administration. a trump win would upend american politics with promises to roll back large parts of president obama's legacy. the billionaire real estate mogul has promised to build a wall on the mexican border, stop muslim refugees from entering the country and -- in a departure from longstanding american tradition -- send his election opponent to jail. from the beginning, trump's narrow road to victory wound through must-win swing states like florida, ohio and north carolina. trump won all of them, and then added georgia even as he maintained slight leads in blue states like michigan and wisconsin, putting him just one or two red states from the 270 electoral votes needed to win. with no political experience to his name, trump defied expectations throughout his unconventional campaign, vanquishing a crowded field of 16 other republicans for the chance to face clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state. the result was one of the most bitter campaigns in modern history, bringing phrases like ""basket of deplorables"" and ""nasty woman"" into daily conversation. despite the unpopularity of both candidates, turnout was up. in the 1,143 counties with 100% precincts reporting as of 10:45p.m.et, 5.6% more voters cast votes than in 2012. the race pitted two candidates with singular qualities: clinton, who would become the first female president after 228 years of men, against trump, whose vast wealth, lack of government experience and blunt rhetoric would redefine the word ""presidential."" his insult-laden speeches and tweets -- which his supporters defended as a refreshing break from political correctness -- were recounted in attack ads that flooded battleground states. even before the vote-casting turned to vote-counting, a sense of history hung over the day. many women wore pantsuits to the polls, an homage to clinton's conservative sartorial style. hundreds of women made a pilgrimage to a rochester, n.y., cemetery, affixing their ""i voted"" stickers to the headstone of susan b. anthony, the suffragist leader whose work paved the way for women'sright to vote. nearly a century later, gender issues were never far from the forefront of clinton's barrier-breaking campaign -- or from trump's. nearly two-thirds of voters who spoke to exit pollsters said they were bothered by clinton's use of a private email server.  even more said they were bothered by trump's treatment of women -- with more than half saying that his conduct bothered them ""a lot."" more than one-tenth of voters said they made up their minds on how to vote in the last few days of the campaign, as the fbi revealed its on-again, off-again investigations into clinton's emails. justin byerly of asheville, n.c., said his decision was difficult. ""until 11 days ago, i was for hillary,"" he said. ""then the emails happened."" exit polls revealed an electorate more educated, more diverse -- and also angrier -- than recent presidential elections. clinton was counting on a big turnout from hispanic and african-american voters, while trump's support was fueled by a frustration about the direction of the country after eight years of obama. clinton and trump both cast their own ballots in solid-blue new york state tuesday morning. clinton and husband bill arrived to cheers at her polling place in chappaqua, n.y. trump's reception at his manhattan polling place was more mixed. he finished voting and then appeared to peek over at wife melania's ballot. asked who he voted for, he joked, ""tough decision."" contributing: heidi m",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,"Trump scores crucial victories in Florida, Ohio",11/9/16
" but elation led to panic by evening, as gop presidential nominee donald trump took key swing states from democratic nominee hillary clinton, including north carolina and ohio. it was a far cry from when polls opened, when the possibility of ending the night with two words -- madam president -- proved electric, and emotions ran the gamut from euphoria to tears. as clinton supporters hit the polls, some women (and men) voters wore white, a nod to the suffrage movement that afforded women the right to vote in 1920. in rochester, n.y., thousands of people, a large majority of them women and girls, queued up to visit the grave of women's rights crusader susan b. anthony, who famously cast a ballot in 1872 knowing it was illegal, and was subsequently arrested. born before she had the right to cast a ballot, ""i'd like to vote twice but that's not possible,"" said 100-year old florence thaler, a resident of pequannock township, n.j. at poll stations, women arrived with their mothers, daughters and sisters. many wore pantsuits as a nod to clinton's signature look. ""just high fived a #pantsuit wearing wearing stranger. this is a weird day,"" tweeted lucy arnold, whose bio identifies her as a teacher and writer. in columbia, s.c., consultant elizabeth wilson set a soundtrack to her day, playing beyoncí©'s run the world (girls) and fleetwood mac's don't stop on her instagram story-documented morning walk to her polling station.  ""the country has been ready, for a few decades, for a woman president,"" she said. but by tuesday night, twitter became a current of worry due to the razor-thin voting margins. ""i'm so anxious and stressed. my stomach is in knots,"" wrote user @michellef0918. ""this election and trump's language has brought up so many traumas for women and this is half the nation telling us, ""oh well,"" tweeted  @alysemigran. in iowa, ruline steininger, 103, began her night watching cnn's early return, offering a stern ""good!"" after each state was  called for clinton. steininger cast her first vote for franklin d. roosevelt in 1940. starting with her annual christmas letter last year, she willed herself to live, writing to her friends and family she ""decided to stay alive to vote for hillary."" ""i thought it was great that a black man got elected for president,"" she said tuesday. ""i didn't think that would happen in my lifetime, but it did. now, it is high time for a woman, and this time we have a woman who is really capable of being president of the united states."" but when the network reported that trump was leading  in florida, she set  her tea down with emphasis. ""don't tell me that,"" she all but yelled at the tv. earlier, at dawn in rochester, the mood had been jubilant and reflective. supporters continued the tradition of decorating suffragette susan b. anthony's headstone at mount hope cemetery with their ""i voted"" stickers. ""i never cried when i filled out my ballot before. but i realized my daughters -- and i have three of them -- have the right to vote for a woman. it made me cry,"" said jodi atkin of irondequoit, n.y., who trekked to the grave site with daughter jessie. both were clad in white. in greenville, s.c.,  inez tenenbaum maintained america was long overdue to have a woman at the helm. ""other women, such as margaret thatcher, angela merkel, indira gandhi, golda meir have led countries for decades,"" said tenenbaum, an attorney who was nominated by president barack obama in 2009 to chair the united states consumer product safety commission. it's taken 96 years since the 19th amendment was ratified for a woman's name to appear as a major party candidate on an general election ballot. ""the march for women's equality has been a long and slow one, but ever since 1920 when women got the right to vote there always has been a back-burner hope that we'd have a first female president. and hillary clinton has worked assiduously to be that person,"" says douglas brinkley, a history professor at rice university. jerry emmett, a 102-year-old from prescott, ariz., whose political idol is hillary clinton, retired to her bed before the race for the presidency was decided. for emmett, who helped report arizona's delegates for hillary clinton at the democratic national convention, the night wasn't all she had hoped it would be.

""i'm an emotional wreck,"" rachel quade, 50, who had been up poll-watching since 5 a.m., texted from a trump-pence party in downtown indianapolis. ""i'm going to cry either way!"" at home in vermillion s.d., lora hubbel, 58, was another bundle of nerves. ""i'm trying to stay busy and only look at the results once in a while,"" she said. she busied herself online, pursuing real estate continuing-education credits. hubbel, one of many white christian evangelicals who voted for the very non-evangelical trump, said she had faith he'd win. with him in the white house, ""everyone's going to get a little more testosterone!"" she said. ""this means more freedom, more initiative."" both women were among scores of trump voters around the nation interviewed this summer by the usa network. others were more confident, based on trump's solid showing tuesday in battleground states. nam yong horn, 62, said she wasn't even considering the possibility of a trump loss: ""oh my god, america is going to be saved!"" the 62-year-old korean immigrant, who lives in southern california, spent last weekend working for trump in las vegas. ""we'll have a real human being in the white house who understands the people,"" she predicted. eugene dunn, a long island limo driver who took his son out of school to attend trump's announcement 17 months ago at trump tower, said he had ""the champagne on ice"" as he awaited the verdict. ""no one i know says they're voting for hillary clinton,"" he said. ""and you look at the yard signs, it was 20-to-1."" losing was unthinkable -- except, he said, that if trump lost he'd have to consider ""an exit strategy"" such as ""moving to the islands, maybe tending bar at a tiki bar."" at the other end of the hope spectrum was barry fixler, a small-town jeweler who opened his own local trump headquarters last year when the campaign didn't do so fast enough. ""donald trump said this election is rigged, and i fully agree with him,"" said fixler, whose shop is in bardonia, n.y., north of new york city. ""i cannot see president obama turning over the government. i'm not being pessimistic, i'm being realistic."" as the votes were counted, the trump optimists and the trump pessimists shared one thing: relief that the campaign was over. jeff lau, 58, who owns a brew pub in york, pa., called it ""the ugliest i've ever seen."" he was hardly sanguine about what came next, regardless of whether his man won or lost, or whether the gop maintained control of the house and senate. ""donald is a little vindictive, and instead of negotiating he'll probably try to dictate to republicans in congress, who didn't really support him,"" lau said. ""they'll push back, and then we'll have gridlock."" trump supporters were torn between pondering the benefits of his election and the costs of his defeat. erwin jackson, a tallahassee, fla., landlord and real estate manager, said a clinton presidency would mean higher taxes and more regulation and could drive him into retirement: ""why work harder? it's just more stress. i'm 66. all four of my brothers have retired. my sons say, 'dad, you've worked all these years.'"" besides such personal concerns, many in trump nation feared for what a defeat would mean for the political process. the aforementioned quade, a 50-year-old real estate agent who lives in suburban indianapolis, said a trump loss would ""mean we're going to a one-party system. if we can't win against such a weak candidate, we have no chance of ever winning again."" trump himself had encouraged such an attitude the previous day, when he said there was no substitute for victory and no consolation in defeat. if he didn't win, he said at a rally in north carolina, ""we've all wasted our time."" he also told a crowd in sarasota, fla.: ""they say we'll get a tremendous amount of credit, win or lose. i said, 'no, no, no, no.' i don't want any credit if we lose."" he sounded an apocalyptic note. ""we will never have another opportunity."" many of his followers agreed. ""this is not the country i grew up in,"" said pat acciavatti, 77, of st. clair township, mich., a retired excavating company owner. he spoke of the 1940s and '50s, when america made half the world's steel in the wake of world war ii. now, he said, ""we're going in the wrong direction. donald trump has a chance to change that. he's the only hope the country has",NEWS; Pg. 3A,USA TODAY,"In Trump Nation, hope and anxiety; Anger is replaced by emotion: 'I'm going to cry either way'",11/9/16
" a donald trump win would mean nothing less than a repudiation of the obama presidency. ""elections have consequences,"" as president obama himself said after his 2008 win. and for obama, it's hard to imagine a more consequential choice. with his former secretary of state in the white house, obama would be able to count  on a successor who will pursue some of his most transformative and controversial policies: immigration reform, the expansion of health care and environmental regulation. trump has pledged to repeal every one of them. ""president hillary clinton will be the closest thing to an obama third term,"" said paul kegnor, a professor at grove city college in pennsylvania. her election solidifies an obama legacy that will be most clearly  felt on social issues, he said. ""the change in the courts is crucial to this. she will solidify the changes at the judicial level for a generation or two."" and as the beginning of one era marks the end of another, the reagan era -- characterized by limited government, social conservatism and anti-communism -- may be fading in the rearview mirror. ""there's never been an opposition party in the history of the united states that's ever won three elections in a row without starting a new era,"" said curt nichols, a political science professor at baylor university who has studied how presidential elections affect the reordering of american politics. as great as they were, the jefferson, jackson, lincoln, roosevelt and reagan eras didn't get solidified until their successors -- often handpicked vice presidents -- won election. alternatively, trump's election would represent a ""hostile takeover"" of the white house, upending the political order with a new brand of politics that doesn't neatly fit into the existing bipartisan framework. judging from his whirlwind campaigning of the past few weeks, no one has been more acutely aware of this history than obama himself. he recited a litany of accomplishments -- from the auto industry rescue to the affordable care act to the paris climate accords. ""all the progress we've made goes out the window if we don't win this election,"" he said in stump speeches in ohio, pennsylvania, north carolina and florida. clinton's election after eight years of obama would make her a democratic president in a democratic era. that puts her in a different position than her husband, former president bill clinton, who knew he was a moderate democratic president in a republican era. ""i hope you're all aware we're all eisenhower republicans,"" he was reported to have said in bob woodward's the agenda: inside the clinton white house. ""we're all eisenhower republicans here, and we are fighting the reagan republicans."" but unlike bill clinton and barack obama, who had democratic congresses for their first two years, clinton would still have to grapple with the gop resistance that characterized most of obama's tenure",NEWS; Pg. 4A,USA TODAY,"An 'Obama era' hinges on a Clinton victory; But if Trump wins, legacy suffers from a 'hostile takeover'",11/9/16
" by the end of the day, however, the mood surrounding her campaign had changed markedly. ""i'll do the very best i can if i'm fortunate enough to win today,"" clinton told reporters after voting in chappaqua, n.y. later that night, at the jacob k. javits convention center in new york, where clinton was scheduled to address supporters at an election night party, supporters were incredulous at the unexpected closeness of her race against donald trump. joseph di thomas, a real estate broker from manhattan, said he was feeling ""really disappointed."" ""i'm feeling let down by all the powers that be that this election was in the bag, and it isn't,"" he said, noting that modeling was ""way off."" ""i was expecting quite a landslide, especially by this hour,"" he said. ""i thought we'd have it in the bag."" in the final hours of clinton's historic bid to become the first female u.s. president, the democratic nominee began the equivalent of a national therapy program to heal the nation, which may be needed after the nastiest and most divisive campaign in modern history, particularly after late tuesday returns showed a much-closer-than-expected race. in last-minute stops across pennsylvania and michigan on monday, states her republican challenger donald trump hoped would pave his path to victory, clinton underscored the need for americans to put aside anger -- and even hate -- that's defined an election dividing americans along racial, class and gender lines. early tuesday evening, clinton's motorcade arrived at the peninsula hotel in new york, where she, along with her family, including husband bill clinton, watched early returns, which would soon show a tight race. among the family members in attendance was the clintons' 2-year-old granddaughter, charlotte, who wore a dress sporting clinton's logo, according to the campaign. later, clinton was scheduled to head to the javits  center, a steel and glass structure the campaign chose for its symbolism in anticipation that the democratic nominee becomes the first woman to ""shatter the highest, hardest glass ceiling,"" as she and her campaign surrogates often say. as election returns rolled in, a group of speakers entertained the crowd, including new york city mayor bill de blasio and the so-called mothers of the movement, a group of african-american women who've lost their children to gun violence. the campaign chose to give the most prominent slot, coming just before the main program, to khizr khan, the gold star father of a muslim solider killed in iraq in 2004. with early returns showing a tight race, the campaign continued to express confidence, saying they still expected to carry the necessary battlegrounds needed to win. even so, the mood in the javits center was subdued. singer katy perry, who performed at a recent clinton rally, took to the stage for brief remarks. ""if you're in a state where the polls are still open, you must vote for hillary clinton tonight,"" she said. others also tried to keep spirits high, including sen. charles schumer, d-n.y., who likened clinton to other female pioneers and predicted she would ""break through that final barrier."" in the campaign's closing days, clinton sought to strike a more unifying note. ""this election will end, but our work together will be just beginning,"" clinton told a gymnasium of about 6,000 at north carolina state university in raleigh early tuesday morning. in an interview with a new hampshire radio station, clinton was asked how she'd hope to be remembered if elected",NEWS; Pg. 4A,USA TODAY,Clinton fans shocked by tight race; Supporters who expected landslide 'feeling let down',11/9/16
" as of tuesday night, though, bill clinton still needed one important thing to happen before crafting a new white house portfolio: a hillary clinton win. returns suggested a closer-than-expected race and even the possibility of the end of the clinton political dynasty. if hillary clinton does become the nation's first female president, her husband would make history as the first man to be the supportive spouse to america's commander in chief. more consequential than that first would be another, historians and analysts say: that said spouse is a former president himself. how the nation's 42nd president would employ experience in a hillary clinton white house remains unclear, but those who've studied the clintons and first ladies agree that he would transform the role. ""nobody likes a social event better than bill clinton does,"" said russell riley, a university of virginia professor and historian who authored inside the clinton white house: an oral history. ""but i don't think that's going to be the end of it."" during the campaign, hillary clinton spoke sparsely about what her husband's role in her administration would be if she got elected. she said she would use him as ""a goodwill emissary"" tasked with ""revitalizing the economy."" he couldn't take on any post requiring senate approval (an anti-nepotism law prevents that), but he could take a cue from his wife, who redefined the role of presidential spouse in the 1990s by taking on a weighty policy portfolio. as the head of her husband's task force on health care, hillary clinton broadened the role of first lady. her work  proved unsuccessful, and a first lady stepping outside of the traditional duties struck a bad chord with some americans, said patrick j. maney, a history professor at boston college. ""it does seem, strangely, that her position as first lady was more problematic than his position would be as first spouse because there was a lot of opposition to her role in hillarycare,"" said maney, who authored bill clinton: new gilded age president. a former twice-elected president such as bill clinton could take on a substantive portfolio and raise far fewer eyebrows, maney said. although the role of first spouse comes with no official job description, the clintons would have to find the right balance between both of their historic roles. it's hillary clinton who would be president, not bill, riley said, and his keeping a distance could prove a ""difficult balancing act."" that wouldn't stop bill clinton from playing a major role in a hillary clinton administration",NEWS; Pg. 4A,USA TODAY,First spouse's role could evolve; Analysts speculate on how Bill Clinton might be involved,11/9/16
" his campaign has left a blemish on american history as ugly as any since the civil war. yet even the smoke from a dumpster fire can have a silver lining. everything positive, from this conservative's perspective, falls into a single category: we have learned a great deal about the country in which we dwell. first, and most obviously, up until trump came along, the anger and alienation of the white working class had been hidden from the view of comfortable coastal elites (the ones who, yes, include me). even if the solutions trump dangled before this demographic -- high tariffs, high walls, seizing iraq's oil and bombing terror-ridden zones into submission -- are precisely the wrong way to go, politicians of both parties will in the future ignore these voters at their peril. immigration woes given that this cohort brought us trump, they might conceivably lock us into permanent division. that need not be the case. a significant majority of americans, polls show, do not want the draconian trumpian approach of deportation of millions and all the special police forces and deportation camps that would entail. politicians may finally be forced to arrive at a sane solution to our immigration woes. trumpism should also compel our leaders to do what they have for too long neglected: articulate the case for policies that for seven decades have served the country well, such as free trade as a path to prosperity and alliances as the path to security, and explain why trump's brute-force approach to counterterrorism would not only fail but also backfire. but we have also learned that we cannot count on the republican party to play a useful role in that process, or in sensible reform in any policy arena. only a handful of gop leaders followed mitt romney's call to reject as a ""con man"" and a ""fake"" the purveyor of trump steaks and casino-bankrupting founder of trump university. the party leadership -- paul ryan, mitch mcconnell and reince priebus -- stuck with their man through every bigoted, racially charged, misogynistic step down into the gutter. republican officials up and down the power structure put party before country and followed the example of sen. marco rubio, who endorsed a man he had labeled unfit to serve as commander in chief. trump deserves gratitude for exposing the gop as a collection of power-seeking cowards, a termite-ridden structure that tumbled at his touch. test of faith trump has also put america's faith communities to the test. the results are revealing. for once, the reflexive liberalism of american jews served them well; trump attracted only a handful of prominent jewish supporters. america's muslims, facing a ban on entry, had no choice at all. mormons, confirming their status as america's model minority, said a polite no thank you to trump's bigotry. the country's catholic leadership, both clerical and intellectual -- with resistance to nativism in their genes -- stood on conviction and rejected the gop nominee for his ""vulgarity,"" ""oafishness,"" ""shocking ignorance,"" ""demagoguery"" and as ""manifestly unfit to be president of the united states"" -- words from a statement signed by many of america's most prominent conservative catholic thinkers. paeans of praise unfortunately, the leaders of evangelical christianity did not fare quite so well. the rev. russell moore of the southern baptist convention, who last month memorably observed, ""the religious right turns out to be the people the religious right warned us about,"" was the brilliant exception to the rule. more typical was pat robertson. ""you inspire us all"" was the opening lyric of his paean of praise to trump, with rev. jerry falwell jr., ralph reed and dozens of other corrupted churchmen chiming in to hail a champion of immorality as america's savior. at the grassroots, as william galston has noted, recent years and quite possibly the appeal of trump himself have encouraged a momentous shift in opinion among white evangelicals, many of whom no longer appear to believe that personal morality needs be ""consistent with an ethical performance of official duties."" the moral majority, which two decades ago pilloried president bill clinton for illicit conduct behind closed doors, now seems quite willing to elevate trump's braggadocious brand of depravity to the white house. that depravity includes trump's boast of grabbing women by their genitals and forcibly planting his repulsive lips on theirs. together with serial sexual predator roger ailes as trump campaign adviser and alleged wife-beater alt-right steve bannon as trump campaign ceo, america has gotten quite an education in how a certain kind of man behaves. with his campaign of hatred and division, trump has made many of america's problems worse, but he has also been an eye-opener. he deserves one hearty cheer for that",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,"A dumpster fire's silver lining; Trump has exposed GOP cowardice, right-wing hypocrisy and working-class anger",11/9/16
" problems cropped up in arizona, florida, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, virginia and other battleground states that would decide whether hillary clinton or donald trump won the presidency. most involved election administration issues that have plagued the polls for decades, rather than incidents of voter fraud or intimidation. a coalition of more than 100 civil rights and voting rights groups running a national election protection hotline reported that 40% of its calls came from african-american and hispanic communities. the majority of complaints came from california, new york, texas, florida, pennsylvania and north carolina. florida saw particularly high levels of voter misinformation.

""this election may be the most chaotic election ... in the last 50 years."" there were widespread problems in north carolina and colorado, two crucial swing states: in durham, n.c., electronic poll books used to check voter registration were down, forcing voters to wait longer and use paper backup copies. the southern coalition for social justice filed a lawsuit in hopes of forcing the durham county board of elections to keep polls open an additional 90 minutes. voting was extended by the state board of elections for up to an hour in eight precincts affected by the malfunctions. judith browne dianis, co-director of the advancement project, a civil rights group, said the durham problem ""makes for the perfect storm of a contested election"" after a dispute over legislative voting restrictions struck down in federal court. ""it's going to be the battleground of the battleground,"" she said. in colorado, portions of the voter-verification system went down for about 30 minutes in the afternoon, briefly forcing state officials to issue provisional ballots to an undisclosed number of voters and briefly preventing them from processing mail ballots. the cause of the problem was under investigation. in ohio, the eligibility of some black voters was challenged at the polls. voters in a heavily somalian community who had conflicting addresses were told to use provisional ballots, which weren't available; signs posted in black neighborhoods warned that voter fraud is a crime. a problem with the calibration of electronic voting machines in lebanon county, pa., caused about a half-dozen machines to display what voters thought were straight republican tickets as straight democratic tickets. poll workers alerted the county elections bureau, and voters were able to change their ballots, said michael anderson, director of the lebanon county bureau of elections. voters were watched by thousands of federal monitors, voting rights advocates, conservative watchdogs and even international observers looking for anything from dirty tricks to acts of violence. observers came from as far as europe and south america to see how america's democratic system held up under pressure. the presidential race tightened in recent days, and trump urged supporters to watch polling stations in ""certain areas"" for signs of fraud. the trump campaign went to court in nevada on tuesday, complaining that the clark county registrar kept an early voting site at a latino market open two hours past closing time friday night. state law allows voters in line when polls close to cast ballots. trump's lawsuit claimed additional voters were allowed to join the line. the complaint, which could ultimately invalidate the votes in question, was swiftly denied. karen hobert flynn, president of common cause, said last-minute polling place changes and other problems in arizona were ""causing real confusion for many voters."" ""this is an election cycle that's just been marked by evidence of the resurgence of voting discrimination,"" said kristen clarke, president of the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law. voting machines fail the most persistent problems were those that crop up every election cycle, such as closed or relocated polling stations, confusion over new voting requirements and faulty voting machines. those and other problems led to long lines in north carolina and texas during the early voting that preceded tuesday's balloting. problems included long lines and delayed poll openings in new york, malfunctioning voting machines in virginia and confusion with closed or delayed-opening polling places in georgia and texas. among the specific incidents: in dover, n.h., misinformation that polls would close at 8 p.m. led officials to extend voting an hour from the closing time of 7 p.m. the city is a democratic stronghold in a crucial battleground state. in maricopa county, ariz., democratic officials asked a judge to keep polls open for two more hours after problems with voting machines and provisional ballots that caused long lines. in washington county, utah, election officials had to scramble to get electronic voting machines back up and running after machines at many precincts failed to operate immediately after polls opened at 7 a.m. only 99 of 380 machines had memory cards programmed correctly. voters were given paper ballots instead. in a detroit precinct in the battleground state of michigan, the machine that counts ballots was not working, causing confusion and anger among voters. workers at the precinct told voters they could either leave their ballots in a secure box to be counted later or wait for a technician. broken ballot-scanning machines and other problems slowed voting at some polling places amid heavy turnout in new york city. only one of two scanners functioned at a polling place in manhattan's gramercy park neighborhood tuesday morning, leading to a line of hundreds of people by 8:30 a.m. the same thing happened at public school 154 in manhattan's harlem neighborhood. court battles on monday, the supreme court denied efforts by democrats to bar trump's supporters from polling places in ohio over concerns they would intimidate voters. conservatives won an arizona legal battle over how ballots are collected, while liberals prevailed in voting rights lawsuits in north carolina and wisconsin. the justice department dispatched more than 500 monitors to 28 states, a reduction in the government's presence inside polling places from nearly 800 monitors in 2012. their task: to determine whether voters were subjected to racial discrimination or other barriers related to language differences or disabilities. federal authorities had said the decentralized and antiquated nature of the country's vote tabulation systems would be difficult to hack, and tuesday, no serious issues had been reported. the department of homeland security, fbi and other agencies were focused on potential internet outages or terrorist plots timed to the election that might be designed to sow fear. in an unprecedented effort to monitor the voting process, more than 1,000 reporters, editors and students collaborated to spot and verify reports of long lines, voter intimidation and other polling place problems. the usa today network was part of that effort, along with propublica, google news lab, univision noticias, the city university of new york graduate school of journalism, first draft and wnyc radio. the information was published on the electionland website",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,"Despite problems, polls at peace; Voters endure plodding lines and disruptive glitches with equipment",11/9/16

""i haven't seen anything where there isn't something that explains what happened,"" she said. nationally, the department of homeland security, fbi and other federal and state law enforcement agencies have incident response teams ready to take action should any threats emerge while voting is underway. in addition, election protection will staff hotlines for voters and have an election geek squad ready to answer technical questions from jurisdictions. individual state election offices are also convening their own swat teams, though most are not publicly discussing their plans. this level of readiness follows u.s. government assertions that russia has been attempting to destabilize the election and accusations by republican candidate donald trump that it is rigged, in addition, the non-partisan election verification network has assembled an elite team of cryptographers, analysts and security experts who are making themselves available to jurisdictions that might need advice or assistance on election day and in the vote counts that follow. federal authorities say the decentralized and often non-electronic voting systems used around the united states make large or even small-scale vote hacking unlikely. concern instead has focused on other types of potential disruption. scenarios that had been suggested include: attacks on states' voter registration databases, which in some cases could potentially result in voters arriving at the polls and finding they aren't listed",NEWS; Pg. 9A,USA TODAY,No cyber issues cropping up in election so far; Groups monitoring election see no early security breaches,11/9/16

" keith kiplinger (thank you for your service, dad) -- i'm somewhat familiar with the ins and outs of veteran family finances ... but not quite as familiar as douglas mccormick, author of family inc. with veterans day coming friday, the  army veteran took some time to share his thoughts on how military service affects  families. q you donated a portion of your royalties to veterans causes. why? a: family inc. is intended to empower every american with the tools required to achieve financial independence. however, as a veteran army officer, i am also using the book to empower the veteran community with financial education. most americans appreciate the sacrifices our service members have made for our country, but few understand the unique financial challenges our veterans face while serving, upon career transition to the civilian workforce and upon retirement. q how has your military background factored into the advice you give? a: it has given me an acute appreciation for the sacrifices of the military community, the unique impediments veterans face in pursuing financial security and the significant skills and assets they possess. i wrote family inc. because i would have benefited from a comprehensive resource to serve as a roadmap for making important financial decisions such as career choice, investing, insurance and retirement when i transitioned from service. q how smoothly did your transition from the military into the private sector go? a: like many veterans, i chose to go back to school after service and got a master's degree in business from harvard. this served as an effective complement my army experiences. however, when i transitioned i had limited savings and lots of obligations such as a mortgage on a home i couldn't sell, credit card debt, and a young family, so the transition was difficult. my situation highlights the importance of making decisions that maximize financial flexibility for veterans preparing for transition. q what are the special financial challenges that military families face? a: while most veterans have highly developed labor skills, such as leadership and teamwork, that make them attractive employees, veterans face unique challenges to achieving financial security, including: eighty-three percent of service members will navigate a mid-career transition. because service members are often deployed abroad and move frequently, they are likely to transition without a well-developed professional network. service members are more likely to have family and dependents at a young age. unemployment and underemployment rates among military spouses are higher than the national average. collectively, these circumstances leave many military families with modest financial resources and limited flexibility to endure the unexpected costs or periods of unemployment that can occur when they transition from the military to a civilian life and career. q how can military families avoid some of the most common mistakes you've observed? a: transitioning military families should  keep these  things in mind: maximize flexibility. families often underestimate the financial risks of transition and don't create enough of a savings buffer to defray unanticipated costs. financial flexibility should be the no. 1 priority for soldiers who might separate within three years. appreciate the additional costs of being civilian. while on active duty, soldiers receive certain types of pay which are not taxed, such as combat or housing allowance pay. additionally, they receive benefits such as health care and commissary privileges. soldiers often underestimate the benefits of these accommodations when planning to become a civilian. learn to play offense in addition to playing defense. dod is very good at helping soldiers stay out of trouble by avoiding things like pay-day loans, maxed-out credit cards and extravagant car purchases (playing defense). but, to create financial security, veterans must also learn how to effectively deploy all of their assets into high-return areas, such as investments in yourself through education and entrepreneurship and a diversified investment portfolio (playing offense). q you are the first financial professional i've run into who tells clients not to bother with budgets. how does that work? a: i find people get distracted with detailed budgets, spend too much time tracking meaningless information, and fail to focus on the issues and decisions that really matter. for this reason, i prefer a monthly high-level review of an income statement, broken into fixed costs and variable costs, as well as a balance sheet, which shows the family's assets, liabilities and net worth. readers can create their own income statement and balance sheet on my website, www.familyinc",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,Some of our veterans' sacrifices are financial,11/9/16

" donald trump, the political novice who was taken seriously by almost no one when he announced his presidential campaign 16 months ago, challenged hillary clinton in battleground states tuesday night with a campaign that defied expectations of an early call in her favor. the most caustic presidential campaign in memory ended with deepened divides by gender, ethnicity and education -- and with new coalitions emerging for the two major parties that could reverberate in american politics for a generation. clinton's democratic coalition included overwhelming support from african-americans and a wide margin among newly energized latinos, plus the backing of most white college-educated women and the affluent -- voters that used to be republicans. trump's republican coalition was almost entirely white and included a crushing margin among men without a college education -- the sort of working-class men who used to be democrats. they were battling for votes in a nation that was divided and downbeat about their leaders and their lives. in exit-poll surveys by edison research, more than three in five voters said things in this country had gotten ""seriously off on the wrong track,"" and two-thirds said their personal financial situation hadn't improved or had gotten worse in the past four years. only a bit more than a third predicted that life for the next generation would be better than life today -- the fundamental tenet of the american dream. for the newly elected president, a political landscape shaped by invective is likely to be as challenging as any in decades. the most common reaction among trump supporters to the idea of clinton's election was ""scared"" -- which was also the most common reaction among hillary clinton supporters to the prospect of trump's election. only one voter in 50 viewed both candidates as trustworthy. nearly one in three voters said neither was. that's not exactly a prescription for a political honeymoon, or even for a respite from a year of partisan combat. historians and political scientists struggled to cite a precedent for a contest so defined by division and attack. the dominant message from each candidate was that the other couldn't be trusted with the keys to the white house. enthusiasm was in notably short supply: fewer than half of voters said they strongly favored their own candidate; four years ago, two-thirds had. ""you'd have to go back to burr-hamilton in the weehawken duel,"" said new york rep. steve israel, an eight-term long island democrat who is retiring. (history class reminder: in 1804, then-vice president aaron burr mortally wounded former treasury secretary alexander hamilton.) ""you'd almost have to say 1860,"" mused nicole hemmer, an assistant professor of presidential studies at the university of virginia. abraham lincoln won that election, but seven southern states moved to secede before he was inaugurated. ""the 1860 election happened and there was no willingness to accept the results, and that of course leads to the civil war. i don't think that's going to happen here, but the idea that a candidate might not accept the results, and that would be part of his big sell to the public, that's not something we've seen before."" trump's nomination alone had been groundbreaking. the bombastic real-estate mogul gained renown in the world of reality tv, not politics or government -- the first major-party candidate since world war ii to lack any experience in government or military command, and one often at odds with the establishment of the party he led. clinton's nomination was groundbreaking as well: the former secretary of state was the first woman nominated for president by a major party in the 240-year history of the republic. sixteen months ago, they launched their candidacies within days and a mile of one another, at trump tower and on roosevelt island. here's a look at what happened in their final showdown tuesday, and why. women roared maybe this shouldn't be a surprise: the campaign featuring the first female nominee -- and one running against a male opponent accused of sexual harassment -- was heading toward an historic gender gap. men backed trump by nine points; women backed clinton by 14, a wider margin than they had given barack obama four years ago. the exit polls indicated that the gender gap, the difference in support for a candidate between male and female voters, likely would surpass the record of 11 percentage points in the 1996 presidential campaign that re-elected bill clinton. close to six in 10 women said his treatment of women bothered them ""a lot;"" just over four in 10 men felt that way. a majority of college-educated women voted for the democratic candidate for the first time since at least 1952, when exit polls allowed demographics characteristics to be analyzed. but the key divisions tuesday weren't only about gender. they also were about education. white women who weren't college graduates? they backed trump by double digits. blue-collar whites turned red there was a time when white men without a college education -- men who worked with their hands, including those in unions -- were a backbone of the democratic coalition fdr forged. but this year, that group gave trump his most avid support, embracing his message that unwise trade deals and competition for jobs from illegal immigrants had cost them their place in the middle class. they backed him by close to 3-1. while clinton was endorsed by the leadership of most labor unions, voters from union households backed her only narrowly. latinos turned out almost two-thirds of latinos were supporting clinton -- or, perhaps, opposing trump for his harsh rhetoric about deporting illegal immigrants and a huge wall along the southern border. the shift among latinos looms as a long-term structural problem for the republicans",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Next leader will inherit division,11/9/16

" a nation that had only recently elected and re-elected its first african-american president had chosen as his successor someone who made racial grievance a central theme of his candidacy. how could that be? ""whitelash"" against president obama was undoubtedly a piece of the hidden vote that helped propel donald trump to his unexpected victory over hillary clinton. but most of trump's supporters were registering their dissatisfaction with the status quo in washington, their insecurity with globalization, and their disdain for elites who seem to have an answer to everything and a solution to nothing. to register this emphatic statement against immigration and free trade -- the american equivalent of britain's shocking ""brexit"" vote -- they were willing to rationalize trump's nasty, impulsive tendencies and his complete lack of experience in government or the military. trump was not this editorial board's choice to be president. in fact, we expressed grave reservations about his fitness for office. those concerns remain, particularly in the national security arena, where presidents have fewer constraints on their power. more than any president in memory, trump will need wise hands at his side. for this reason, it is vital for the republican foreign policy experts who have scorned him to come forward to help. entrusting the nuclear codes to a naturally combative man with an inability to ignore slights is a frightening prospect. so is trump's troubling admiration for russia's vladimir putin and other autocrats. but trump is the person chosen by the american people. and, in our democracy, that is reason enough to accept the result. those who voted against him should assume the role of loyal, constructive opposition and work peacefully within the system. on wednesday, trump, clinton and obama all set the right tone in trying to calm an unnerved nation, steady the financial markets, and pave the way for a peaceful transition of power following an unusually divisive, mean-spirited campaign. in his late-night victory speech, trump struck an uncharacteristically conciliatory chord, congratulating clinton for a hard-fought campaign and promising to seek unity. clinton responded with a gracious concession, saying she hopes that trump ""will be a successful president for all americans."" obama reinforced the message, noting that all americans have a stake in the new president's performance. at least on domestic policy, the nation is blessed by its founding fathers with a system of checks and balances. it has an independent judiciary and a legislative branch to restrain the more destructive initiatives of an ill-prepared president. trump would, for instance, likely run up against opposition should he try to prosecute clinton or ban foreign muslims from entering the country. with republicans retaining control of both chambers of congress, trump has a clearer path toward rolling back obamacare, killing proposed trade deals and naming a supreme court justice to replace the late antonin scalia. but trump will also face major challenges on the political and economic front, finding that many of his proposals are unworkable. in fact, many of them are not so much proposals as aspirations. he will not, for instance, be able to snap his fingers and bring back manufacturing jobs. his failure to deliver on his grandiose promises threatens to leave his supporters even more disillusioned about politics than they already are",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Trump's surprise victory leaves a nation unnerved,11/10/16

" regardless of his personal fallibilities, the majority of americans who voted sought someone outside of the mainstream washington establishment, someone who is beholden to no one except the american people. this is something establishment politicians have shown little desire to do. the fact that pollsters and the mainstream media were so convinced that trump had no chance of winning demonstrates just how out of touch many of our ""elites"" are with ordinary americans. michael pravica henderson, nev. the traditional news media tried to warn us. many major newspaper disavowed donald trump's candidacy. but in the facebook age, the electorate is looking at memes, not policies or substance. it was the ""liberal"" news media that let down the american public. journalists were trying so hard to appear balanced in their coverage that they created false equivalencies. yes, both candidates had their faults and sins, but the depth and severity were not equivalent. trump has a well-documented history of racism and bigotry that stretches back decades. clinton called minority repeat offenders ""superpredators"" 20 years ago. trump has years and years of denigrating women in the most disgusting ways. clinton was ugly to the women who had entanglements with her husband. the trump foundation  rarely helped anyone other than the trumps. the clinton foundation has helped millions. it goes on and on. when trump lied to americans, journalists gave him a pass. when he was fact-checked and he still repeated those lies, there was no outcry. the ""liberal"" news media candy-coated the worst of trump's attributes and made them palatable to the american electorate",NEWS; Pg. 12A,USA TODAY,"Polls, news media don't know what hit them",11/10/16
" the nation's new commander in chief is moving to town with formidable political assets and limited political debts. start with unified republican control of congress, similar to the serendipitous situation president obama and the democrats enjoyed for two years at the beginning of his tenure. despite dire predictions trump's candidacy could spur a wave that would undermine republicans down the ballot, his stronger-than-expected draw at the top of the ticket in such states as missouri and indiana helped the gop maintain control of the senate and minimize losses in the house. what's more, the real estate magnate and reality tv star defeated democrat hillary clinton without the customary support (and the obligations those incur) from senior party leaders and big donors, many of whom distanced themselves or even opposed him. ""what donald trump pulled off was an enormous political feat,"" house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., said wednesday on capitol hill. ""he just earned a mandate."" ryan never actually campaigned with trump. ""he's already changed the republican party into something very different in a way that's alarmed some of us,"" said vin weber, who as a minnesota congressman played a key role in the gop takeover of the house in 1994. ""he has the opportunity to be a transformational president because he's shaken up the system in a real way; he's changed the agenda in a real way, and he carried in a republican congress with him. he has an opportunity to change america that's greater than any of his predecessors since (ronald) reagan."" trump's upset victory puts him in a strong position to deliver on his campaign rhetoric: restoring a conservative majority on the supreme court by appointing a justice to fill the vacancy left by the death of antonin scalia, reversing president obama's executive orders on immigration, blocking any serious consideration of the pacific rim trade deal, repealing or revamping the affordable care act and even reconsidering the iran nuclear deal. that said, trump faces limits and some dangers. the first president in u.s. history without experience in government or military command, trump lacks the base of knowledge and the network of allies his predecessors relied on -- and he'll work in a constitutional system of checks and balances that constrains presidents in a way the business world doesn't typically constrain ceos. ""there are certain areas where trump can quite quickly put his imprint on the government,"" says lawrence jacobs, director of the the center for the study of politics and governance at the university of minnesota. ""the government, though, is also going to grind down donald trump."" there's also the risk of overreach. ""republicans have only won more votes in a national election one time since 1988,"" says simon rosenberg, president of the new democratic network, noting that clinton won the popular vote even though trump carried the electoral college. ""there just isn't broad support for their agenda."" rosenberg acknowledges that democrats need ""a new generation of leaders to rise and assume national positions of leadership to replace the obamas, the clintons and the bidens,"" dominant party figures who are poised to leave elective politics upon trump's inauguration. at that point, the democratic party, jolted and dispirited by tuesday's unexpected setbacks, will be left to rely mostly on the power of the senate filibuster to block action. ""the risk of centrifugal forces dividing the party further is significant,"" says democratic pollster mark mellman, an adviser to democratic congressional leaders. ""by the same token, a midterm election tends to be good for the 'out' party."" that, though, is two years and a political lifetime away. trump is now the face of the gop, but he leads a party that has its own fractures, though critics from former president george w. bush to 2012 nominee mitt romney called or tweeted their congratulations and pledges of support wednesday. that doesn't change the fact that some of trump's campaign rhetoric, on stepping back from security commitments abroad and limiting free trade, conflict with republican orthodoxy. ""he's got a lot of challenges ahead of him, which i'm sure he's aware of,"" says gop pollster david winston, an adviser to republican congressional leaders. ""this was a very divisive campaign, and he needs to forge a governing majority. the republican primaries were very complicated and heated, and he went into a general election that was equally as complicated and heated."" the defining feature of the election, winston says, was the fact that the two most disliked presidential candidates in history were running against one another. both were given unfavorable ratings from a majority of the electorate. in the surveys of voters as they left polling places, for instance, 14% said neither candidate was qualified to serve as president. those voters ended up breaking for trump 69%-15% -- part of his winning coalition, to be sure, but a constituency that presumably still needs to be won over by his performance in office. still, throughout his improbable presidential campaign, trump demonstrated again and again that he had a better read of the electorate's mood and a surer ability to reach voters who felt disenfranchised than the pundits, the pollsters and the high-priced consultants. ""a lot of us were questioning his trips to michigan and to wisconsin and to minnesota,"" jacobs says.

""she has made history in a nation that is good at so many things, but that's made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected to federal office."" clinton made it clear that while americans must ""cherish"" the constitution's democratic tradition of a peaceful transfer of power, they should fight to protect its core values of the rule of law, equal rights and freedom of worship. these are all constitutional protections her campaign had argued were at risk with a trump presidency. the first female major-party presidential nominee concluded by urging the women who supported her not to lose faith in their dreams. ""we have still not shattered that highest, hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will. and hopefully sooner than we might think right now,"" she said. ""to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your"" dreams, she added. several hours earlier, clinton had called trump to congratulate him on becoming the nation's president-elect. however, she did not make an appearance before backers gathered at the jacob k. javits convention center for what they had hoped would be a victory party. instead, her campaign chairman, john podesta, made brief remarks. ""it's been a long night, and it's been a long campaign, but i can say we can wait a little longer,"" he told clinton's despondent supporters. outside the new yorker hotel in manhattan, where clinton would deliver her concession remarks wednesday, disappointed supporters gathered, many still wearing their guest badges from the previous night's campaign event. anita broccolino said she wanted to get into the event ""to show support for hillary, to show her we love her."" the loss was a shock to the clinton team after most major polls showed her with a comfortable lead in all of the major battleground states, including pennsylvania, a blue-leaning state that republicans hadn't carried since 1988 -- until trump's win there tuesday. a few weeks ago, clinton's lead was  more pronounced. after the third debate in las vegas, in which trump called clinton a ""nasty woman"" and would not commit to honoring the outcome of the election, an abc news tracking poll showed clinton leading the gop nominee by 11 points nationally. later in the month, fbi director james comey announced that his agency was reviewing new emails that might be relevant to its investigation of her private email server, but just two days before the election, comey said the emails were either duplicates or not germane and that he was making no change in his previous recommendation against criminal charges. still, the move revived the  issue that had proved most damaging to clinton's candidacy -- and her polling numbers began to reflect it. democrats will now begin a long process of soul-searching. during the heat of the campaign, they had remained optimistic that a number of the setbacks they'd encountered, including the wikileaks email hack linked to russia, were survivable",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Clinton: 'We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead',11/10/16
" not since truman beat dewey more than six decades ago had there been anything like it. the shock extended from true believers who were there when real estate mogul came down the trump tower escalator 17 months ago to diehard never trumpers. it stretched from wall street to embassy row to hollywood. but why was the outcome of the 2016 presidential election so shocking? donald trump had long ago established himself a political savant. without ever having run for, or served on, so much as a school board, he emerged from a deep, experienced field to capture the republican nomination. and pre-election polls showed clinton with only a narrow lead, the sort of edge that the brexit vote earlier this year had showed to be so tenuous. consider, in contrast, the hole in which president harry truman stood in 1948 against new york gov. thomas dewey. not only did truman lag in every public opinion poll, but his democratic party was ideologically split; its left and right wings each ran candidates in the  election. if truman could win, anyone can. but americans were shocked when trump did. the epicenter of awe was the javits center in new york, where clinton held an election night party that became a wake. it extended to her alma mater, wellesley college, where thousands of women from around the world came to celebrate america's first female president. and from there to foreign trading desks, where u.s. stock futures plummeted. ""i'm shocked,'' duke university freshman divya juneja told the campus paper. ""i honestly thought this election would be a landslide.'' clinton partisans weren't the only ones surprised. consider barry fixler, a jeweler who opened a trump headquarters last year on his own dime in  bardonia, n.y. on tuesday he declared the election lost -- rigged for clinton, he said. the next day he was ecstatically agog. ""never saw this coming,'' he said why did so many people feel the same way? partly it was the polls, which in aggregate created the impression clinton was inevitable. she wasn't far ahead, but she'd been ahead for so many months that some people had trouble imagining any other result. ""after the conventions i had a sense trump had a serious chance, but i got lulled by the polls,'' said no less an expert than boston college political scientist marc landy, author of presidential greatness. ""the pollsters have a lot to answer for.'' partly it was the decisiveness of trump's victory -- how he won so many battleground states so narrowly, including ones like pennsylvania and wisconsin that had seemed like democratic bastions. partly it was because trump's policies and plans remain vague (like getting mexico to pay for a southern border wall) or frightening (mass deportations of undocumented immigrants). and partly it was the simple realization -- which came to some only when they actually saw trump claim victory around 3a.m. et on the stage of the new york hilton -- that ""the american people have elected donald trump president,'' said the novelist thomas mallon, enunciating the words as if they were painful. after that, he said, ""i left the republican party.'' the election of 1948 remains the one by which all political shockers are measured. truman pulled off an upset that produced a classic image: him holding up a newspaper  with the headline ""dewey defeats truman.'' if the outcome was surprising, the winner himself was (unlike trump) the most known of political commodities. truman had been president for more than three years, dropped the atomic bomb on japan and presided over the end of world war ii. he was a machine democrat who'd spent his adult life in government. and he wasn't that different from the presumed winner, a moderate internationalist anti-communist like himself. mallon, author of the novel dewey defeats truman, was asked to compare the two election results",NEWS; Pg. 1A,USA TODAY,Divided nation united by shocker; Both sides of the aisle stunned by decisive Republican victory,11/10/16
" when the nation was desperate for accurate projections, many pollsters whiffed. although most correctly predicted hillary clinton's narrow popular-vote victory, vaunted poll averages and complex mathematical forecasts largely failed to envision donald trump's rise to the presidency through a triumph in the electoral college. the ramifications reverberated swiftly wednesday as pundits and voters mocked the surveyors for bumbling their quadrennial moment in the spotlight. the prevailing question is which polls will survive to 2020 and what adjustments will be required to avoid another blunder. many public polls already had disappeared as news organizations ended them amid deteriorating finances. ""at some point, you have to be at least reasonably close,"" said terry jones, commentator editor at investor's business daily, whose final ibd/tipp tracking poll was the only major national poll in november to give trump the lead in a race including minor-party candidates. ""if you're not making corrections to your polling technique to represent what's happened, your value goes down."" in the final average of four-way polls tracked by realclearpolitics, clinton led 45.5% to trump's 42.2%, libertarian gary johnson's 4.7% and green party candidate jill stein's 1.9%. polls that consistently gave clinton a comfortable lead in recent weeks included bloomberg politics, cbs news, fox news, reuters/ipsos, usa today/suffolk, quinnipiac, monmouth, economist/yougov and nbc news/sm, according to realclearpolitics. all the major forecasters who base their predictions on poll averages and added methodology made clinton the heavy favorite, including statistics guru nate silver's fivethirtyeight.com, the new york times' theupshot and the princeton election consortium. silver's team was consistently more conservative about clinton's chances, pegging her probability of winning at about 71% in its final forecast. the problem with forecasters is that they rely on polls. when the polls go bad, forecasting models go awry. ""it seems like something went wrong for sure"" with the polls, said micah cohen, politics editor at fivethirtyeight. ""national polls weren't that far off, but they were off. state polls were off, and most importantly, they were all off in the same direction -- they underestimated trump support."" of 61 national polls tracking a two-way race during that period, six gave trump the lead. all six were the l.a. times/university of southern california poll, one of the only polls to use a recruited panel of voters sharing their opinions online instead of over the phone. experts said national polls appear to have overestimated the percentage and number of minority voters who would back clinton while underestimating white support for trump, particularly among women. overall turnout appeared to be lower than expected, lifting trump. ""the support that hillary clinton received among african-americans and among latinos seems to be lower than the support that barack obama received in 2012,"" said michael traugott, professor at the university of michigan institute for social research's center for political studies.

""but the people who didn't vote last time are more likely to be trump supporters,"" said arie kapteyn, director of usc's dornsife center for economic and social research, whose poll consistently pegged trump as the leader in recent months. ""if you eliminate people who didn't vote last time, you may have eliminated too many trump supporters."" andra gillespie, political scientist at emory university, said the results call into question whether pollsters should even try to assess the likelihood of respondents actually voting. she said pollsters also appeared to misunderstand the importance of education levels in determining results. still, she rejected partisan accusations that liberal pollsters purposely slanted their results in clinton's favor. ""that type of rhetoric is unfair,"" she said. methodology will be scrutinized. gillespie said the l.a. times/usc poll's  panel of online voters could gain traction. declining rates of voter response to phone polls and increased cellphone usage are making it more difficult and costly to poll voters through traditional methods. even as pollsters and forecasters endure more heat for their role in painting clinton as the heavy favorite, cohen said his site is ""pretty confident in our process,"" which delivers probabilities not ""deterministic statements.""

" trump the next u.s. president, lawyers and a judge dealt with new motions in a california court in what may be one of the most important of 75 or so open lawsuits involving trump and his businesses. in fact, the past seven days saw a flurry of motions and rulings in one of the class-action lawsuits brought by former trump university students, who say the republican president-elect's company ripped them off for tens of thousands of dollars in tuition for a sham real-estate course. the trump university cases are among the most serious  because they involve allegations of fraud and racketeering. among the other cases are a $4 million lawsuit brought by a republican political consultant who said trump defamed her; a class-action claiming his presidential campaign broke consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages to people's cellphones; and a suit by a golf club employee who says she was fired after complaining to her bosses about sexual harassment. in any one of the cases, an official ruling by a court that trump or his company were financially liable for fraud could provide congress with grounds for impeachment.  a hearing thursday in the california case hashing out motions will set the tone for the trial, set for nov. 28. ""if the fraud and racketeering allegations against president-elect trump are true, he is legally impeachable for high crimes or misdemeanors,"" said christopher peterson, a law professor at the university of utah who has researched the trump university cases, who acknowledged that while that's technically the case, a republican-controlled congress makes proceedings unlikely. ""whether he is politically impeachable is another matter."" nevertheless, peterson said  wednesday that a  drawn-out  exposure of a sitting president to witness testimony, embarrassing documents or a high-profile trial could be time-consuming and distracting, and come with lingering political cost. trump's attorneys often settle lawsuits, according to usa today network's analysis of more than 4,000 court cases involving trump and his companies over the decades, and peterson said that may prove the wisest course in the remaining trump university actions.

" so what kind of flotus will she be? according to first-lady historians, here's a hint: think jackie kennedy, not eleanor roosevelt, hillary clinton or michelle obama. ""in terms of the evolution of the first lady, i see  (trump) moving us back to the more traditional role,"" says jean wahl harris, who studies the role of the first lady at the university of scranton. ""a very traditional social hostess is something i think she will be comfortable with."" she will be expected to be front and center, not shy and retiring like bess truman in the 1940s. but trump, 46, was hardly on the campaign trail, so what's to stop her from doing the unexpected as first lady? ""starting with kennedy, the expectations have ratcheted up. it's not just about being a good wife and mother,"" harris says. ""americans expect (the first lady) to be a celebrity, to be seen, to support your husband, to have a project that's good for the nation. and we expect to see you."" she ""will surely rise to the rather rigid strictures of a job whose very existence is something of an anachronism,"" says elizabeth mehren, professor of journalism at boston university and expert on first ladies. ""mrs. trump has signaled that her 'cause' may be cyberbullying, a safe bet for the mother of a 10-year-old, but less safe for the wife of someone who sends mean tweets at 3 in the morning."" what makes melania trump historic? first foreign-born flotus in 191 years.  born in slovenia in eastern europe in 1970, trump will be the first first lady not born in the usa since louisa adams, wife of  john quincy adams, who was born in england in 1775, when america was still an english colony, and took office in 1825. first wife no. 3. past presidents have had multiple wives  (reagan, ford, wilson, theodore roosevelt among them), but no one else before president-elect trump has been married and divorced twice before marrying a third time. first former fashion model. trump made her living as fashion model melania knauss before and after she came to the usa and met trump at a fashion party. they married in 2005 and have one son, barron, 10. first to have posed nude. she took it all off for photographers at least twice: the new york post ran one set of images in july of trump in her birthday suit in 1995, when she was 25. british gq ran its own set of images, from 2000, in march and again online tuesday of trump sprawled on a fur throw, wearing nothing but jeweled bracelets  and a handcuff. first for whom english is not her first language. her native language is slovenian, but she also speaks english, french, serbian and german. that fluency could come in handy for the new president, as it did for president kennedy, whose wife spoke french and spanish. ""i see her going back to a jackie kennedy model of first lady,"" harris says. ""she's not going to want to be in the public eye. jackie kennedy wanted to protect her children and herself. melania will be like that -- she won't like talking in public."" douglas brinkley, a presidential historian at rice university, also sees her in the ""mold"" of jackie kennedy. ""somebody who has keen eye on fashion, who doesn't interfere with policymaking in a public way. she will travel and be courted around europe as someone who is glamorous. ... there's no advantage for her to get involved in politics in a visceral way."" as a former  model, she can help boost the fortunes of the american fashion industry, the way mrs. obama did almost every time she appeared in public. trump also will be expected to fill the ""oldest job"" of the first-lady role, says lisa kathleen graddy, curator at a first-ladies exhibit at the smithsonian's national museum of american history. ""the through-line between martha washington and michelle obama is the role of administration hostess, the public face of the administration,"" graddy says. but since trump himself was a mold-breaker, so might be melania, says mark feldstein, a professor of journalism at the university of maryland. ""i think all bets are off as far as usual expectations, and that applies to the first lady as well as trump himself."" melania can help soften trump's tempestuous image, brinkley says.

""it's this combination of shock, despair and sadness, and definitely anger,"" says chong, who was personally pleased that californians voted in a ballot measure to legalize marijuana for recreational use. ""thank god pot is legal now, so we have something that can get us through the next four years. ""but this is a town full of actors -- we get rejected all the time,"" adds chong, a bernie sanders supporter who voted for clinton. ""work will go on in hollywood. we're going to move on to the next gig."" it's too early to determine just how the entertainment capital of the world will be  affected by a trump presidency. but it's doubtful there will be much immediate change in the production of movies and tv, says robert thompson, director of the bleier center for television and popular culture at syracuse university and an expert on the intersection  of politics and culture. ""as long as there's continuity of government, i don't see this having a big effect on hollywood,"" he says. ""how the entertainment industry makes movies isn't going to change in the short term."" people are always tempted to predict major change after  surprising things happen, thompson says. ""that's the mistake we made after sept. 11, when everyone said 'irony is dead' and 'we're not going to make more movies with explosions in them,' and that kind of thing."" it didn't happen. ""people who didn't vote for (trump) are shocked and unhappy today, but that was true with (george w.) bush in 2000. whether that will change the dynamic of what (hollywood) makes and how they make it ... ?"" thompson left that question hanging. jeff bock, senior box office analyst for exhibitor relations, predicts the election results will push filmmakers to make more political films, political statements within films, and satire. that shift will take time to materialize. ""whenever there is a lot of strife and hollywood is up against something, creative energy gets pumped into the process,"" bock says. ""more political films will work into the pipeline; that will happen. and expect the old white guy to return as the hollywood prototype villain for the next four years -- we haven't seen that in a while. he will now have a big hairpiece."" a possible backlash? even the concept of satire -- especially political satire, which surged during the contentious election, from stephen colbert to samantha bee -- has been called into question. omarosa manigault, a former contestant on the apprentice and donald trump advocate, told independent journal review at trump's election night party in new york city that trump's enemies will be placed on a  list ""so that when we get into the white house, we know where we stand."" ""retribution"" against hollywood and the media, a favorite trump target, is a possibility, says rich greenfield, a securities analyst at btig research. ""the media industry broadly defined (spanning news and entertainment organizations) aggressively supported"" clinton, he wrote wednesday in a research report for his company. it's ""unclear what president-elect trump could do, but (it's) certainly an unquantifiable risk for the sector overall. donald j. trump was a wild card as a candidate. we will see if the same applies to his presidency."" syracuse professor and free-speech expert roy gutterman points out that satire is protected by the first amendment and the supreme court. but the mood is cautious, especially with trump slotted to fill a supreme court vacancy. ""the concern is, everything is changing. my hope is that satire still has the same first amendment protections tomorrow that it had two days ago,"" gutterman says. ""but everything seems to be topsy-turvy right now."" historian douglas brinkley, whose books include the wilderness warrior: theodore roosevelt and the crusade for america, expects the trump white house to open its doors to celebrities -- that is, conservative ones -- and country stars rather than the usual train of actors who have graced the white house during the obama administration. ""donald trump is an í_ber-celebrity,"" brinkley says. ""i'm sure that the trump white house is going to be having all sorts of celebrities there, but the core constituents will be more conservative. you know, a white house dinner for clint eastwood, or a screening of mel gibson's new movie. it's not going to be inviting rock 'n' roll singers to perform, like hillary clinton did with bon jovi and bruce springsteen."" industry website thewrap.com founder and editor sharon waxman says one immediate effect  will be soul-searching by waves of vocal celebrity clinton supporters, who range from madonna to lady gaga to justin timberlake. difficult questions ""many of those celebrities who worked for hillary clinton are wondering if their contribution didn't help -- or worse, hurt,"" waxman says. ""no one has missed the fact that virtually no major stars worked on the trump campaign. it raises the takeaway question for celebrities: what is the nature of their influence and their connection to fans?"" marc fisher of the washington post, co-author of the biography trump revealed, predicted a ""flowering of protest art: movies, videos, books and so on that pose a challenge to trump's ideas and values."" but he also thinks hollywood will search for ways to connect with trump's supporters. ""that could mean a golden few years for writers and directors who specialize in themes connected with class conflict, military matters, faith and cultural issues such as family, marriage, sexuality and technology,"" fisher says. conservative filmmaker lionel chetwynd says opposition from the hollywood left to trump was ""more intense than anything i've ever seen, and i go back to reagan. they swallowed everything they were told about him, and the fear was almost as intense as europeans hearing hitler was on the march."" chetwynd says hollywood liberals have lost any connection to the ""rest of the country,"" even though they sell movies to that audience. franklin leonard, founder of the black list, an annual survey of hollywood's most well-regarded but unproduced screenplays, says he doesn't know of any scripts in the marketplace that focus on trump. ""i imagine there will be quite a bit written about that in the months and years to come,"" he says, although two relevant scripts made the list in recent years: rodham, ""a hillary clinton script about her political coming-of-age"" that hit the list in 2012, and college republicans, ""a script about lee atwater and karl rove as young college republicans."" the latter ""tells a story of the evolution of the republican party and sort of how it became the party that could endorse donald trump,"" leonard says. neither script, however, is in development. business will continue, with an awareness of new sensitivities, he says.

" hispanics favored democratic candidate hillary clinton 65% to 29%, a 36-point difference  that helped her secure winning margins in states such as nevada and colorado and kept her competitive late into the night in  other key battleground states. that margin, based on exit polling conducted by edison research, was smaller than the 71%-27% split that president obama won in 2012. and it was smaller than the 72%-21% her husband, president bill clinton, won in 1996. hillary clinton's final tally ran counter to polls leading up to election day that had trump's support far lower, including a latino decisions poll conducted just before the election in eight swing states that estimated trump's support among hispanics at just 18%. after a campaign that started with trump referring to some mexicans as rapists, calling for mass deportations and proposing a wall along the southwestern border, the final results left hispanics, immigration advocacy groups and polling experts scratching their heads. ""that's implausible,"" said alan abramowitz, an emory university political science professor who studies public opinion and election voting behavior. abramowitz and others figured trump's support would be minimal. he said polling experts will spend the next few weeks crunching election data to see whether there were flaws in the predictions or the exit polls. in 2004, for example, exit polls showed president george w. bush winning 44% of the hispanic vote, which was revised down to 40% once more detailed voter information came out. ""we're going to see some debate about this question,"" abramowitz said. despite the outcome, polling experts say a larger hispanic margin for clinton wouldn't have been able to swing the election. daniel smith, a political science professor at the university of florida, said hispanics couldn't have offset the massive gains trump made with white voters from florida to north carolina to pennsylvania. ""you can't lay this on hispanics,"" smith said. ""i don't think that's where the election was won or lost. it had to do with white, suburban voters, especially women, breaking much more for trump than anyone expected."" while pollsters begin sorting through  the voting data, hispanics who voted for trump say they paid little attention to the polls and pundits anyway. denise galvez, a cuban american who co-founded latinas for trump, said they all focused too heavily on trump's bombastic rhetoric and ignored the quiet, growing share of the hispanic electorate that was willing to understand his platform. galvez said she never believed that he really wanted to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants or that he felt all mexicans were rapists and drug dealers. ""i knew and acknowledged his faults,"" she said. ""but everybody took him out of context. how everybody extrapolates that he hates all mexicans and he hates all hispanics and he hates all immigrants is absolutely ridiculous."" instead, galvez said, trump pushed a reasonable immigration strategy that would target undocumented immigrants with criminal records, find a solution for those who are working hard in the usa and finally gain control of the country's borders. for josefina rocabado, 50, who immigrated to miami from the dominican republic in 1979, trump's economic policies were more important. the insurance company manager said she felt insulted by the clinton campaign's ""brainwashing"" of hispanics by suggesting those who didn't support the democrat were betraying their roots rather than being more motivated by other issues.

" some speculated that the makeup of the fed would change under trump. in the aftermath of trump's victory to become the 45th president of the united states, both of those theories are in question. some economists and futures markets still expect the fed to act after stocks rebounded from a stomach-churning overnight sell-off. paul ashworth of capital economics told investors immediately after trump won, while global markets and u.s. stock futures were in disarray, that he expected the fed to hold off. but after markets rallied wednesday following trump's conciliatory victory speech, ""you could see the fed following through,"" he told investors in a conference call. he noted economic growth and inflation are likely to pick up in coming months. the fed lifted its benchmark rate in december for the first time in nine years but has held it steady since amid market volatility, the united kingdom's brexit vote, china's economic slowdown and meager u.s. inflation. the fed signaled in its post-meeting statement last week it's poised to raise its federal funds rate from a historically low 0.4% in december, barring adverse shocks to the economy. economic growth accelerated in the third quarter after a sluggish nine months, job growth has been steady and wage gains picked up in october, auguring more rapid inflation. bernard baumohl, chief global economist of the economic outlook group, said the fed will move next month in part to provide space to lower rates again next year. wednesday, fed fund futures gave about 76% odds of a rate increase in december, unchanged from the previous day. other economists said the fed is likely to take a pass next month",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,"Assumed a done deal, rate hike in December again up in the air",11/10/16

""our thesis this year was, 'angry' is the new hope -- largely on the idea that the lack of economic growth was generating anger among the voters themselves,"" said dan clifton, head of policy research for market research firm strategas. ""what we're seeing is a great degree of political volatility that has stemmed from this economic volatility."" trump's promises to punish u.s. companies for outsourcing work, slap tariffs on certain foreign goods and renegotiate free-trade agreements were among his principal objectives. whether those proposals will  spark job growth -- and whether they're achievable at all -- is debatable. gary burtless, a senior fellow at the brookings institution, said raising tariffs on imports from countries such as china and japan could temporarily boost u.s. jobs. but in the long run, ""are these policies going to frighten business leaders and investors about the wisdom of u.s. policymaking?"" burtless  asked in an interview. the best bet to spark quick job growth might be a bipartisan deal on infrastructure investment, burtless said. that could include roads, bridges and water pipelines -- areas in which the presidential contenders shared some common ground. ""we are currently in a phase where public investment in infrastructure has been declining,"" burtless said. ""if you think the country really does have a lot of underemployment, it does seem a strange time to scale back infrastructure."" trump's economic advisers floated a proposal last month that would provide tax credits to investors who acquire infrastructure bonds, arguing that $167billion in private investments could spark $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. but, ""if he pays for this infrastructure boost by gutting spending elsewhere, he'll ruin the job creation impact,"" said josh bivens, director of research and policy for the economic policy institute. although infrastructure spending might help at home, it won't bring back any jobs from overseas. one pragmatic way to fight back against globalization is to bolster education of highly skilled workers at home. the usa is trailing on that front. in india, growth in the number of people with ""higher skills"" is projected at 14.6% from 2015 through 2020, compared with 11.2% for the usa during that period, according to market research firm euromonitor international. most of trump's rhetoric has been aimed squarely at the impact of trade on the u.s. economy. during the campaign, trump decried the north american free trade agreement that hastens economic activity between the usa, mexico and canada. he blasted companies such as dearborn, mich.-based automaker ford motor for launching plants in mexico",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,Trump gets his chance to be the 'greatest jobs president'; But whether his proposals will spark growth is debatable,11/10/16
"s.  retreats from open-trade policies that have defined the past generation and cracks down on undocumented workers, economists say. those policies could more than offset a jolt to consumer and business spending from tax cuts. experts  have tamped down forecasts calling for a  recession by 2018 based on the assumption that even a republican congress will pass only modified versions of trump's proposals. some economists say the federal reserve is likely to forgo an anticipated interest rate hike in december and  keep rates lower for longer, mitigating some of the damage to  growth and financial markets. ""it's not a cataclysmic event for the economy,"" says mark zandi, chief economist of moody's analytics. but, he adds, ""at the very least, it means the economy will grow more slowly."" many firms are likely to be gripped by anxiety. ""the uncertainty ... will cause businesses to be more cautious in their hiring and investment,"" zandi says. the uneasiness will be greatest for multinationals that depend on exports for much of their revenue and businesses that employ legal and illegal immigrants, says economist gus faucher of pnc financial services group. overall, zandi expects the economy to grow an average 1.75% a year in trump's term, down from a 2% baseline, creating 400,000 fewer jobs annually. here's a look at some of trump's proposals and what they could mean for the economy: taxes trump wants to slash taxes across the board for households by combining the seven tax brackets into three. the top rate would fall to 33% from 39.6%. all americans would pay less taxes, but the biggest benefits would go to the wealthy, according to the tax policy center. the savings should boost consumer spending  the next two years, zandi says. corporate tax rates would plunge to 15% from 35%, and the rate for smaller businesses that pay the personal rate would drop to 15%. that should help make the usa a more attractive location for multinationals. tax revenue would fall by $6.2 trillion over the next decade, the tpc says. trump says the shortfall could be closed by new revenue from a more vibrant economy and spending cuts. zandi expects a debt-wary congress to pass only about a third of trump's cuts. still, he says, the deficit would swell and interest rates would rise, curbing borrowing and economic activity. trade trump is likely to make good on his pledge to declare china a currency manipulator because of its efforts to push down the value of the yuan, zandi says. trump has threatened tariffs of 45% on chinese imports and 35% on mexican products, and wants to kill a proposed trade deal with pacific rim countries. more likely, zandi says, are modest tariffs and tougher inspection and other standards that curb imports, raising prices for u.s. consumers. that could spark retaliation by affected countries. trump aims to coax manufacturers that have moved jobs abroad to return to the usa and discourage offshoring by u.s. manufacturers. zandi says such a scenario is unlikely because of uncertainty over whether the trade barriers will be permanent. faucher says the tariffs are unlikely to outweigh offshoring's other benefits, such as lower overseas wages and taxes. immigrant workers trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the mexican border. undocumented workers make up about 5% of the labor force, and the departure of some would make it tougher for employers to find employees, zandi says. infrastructure trump  unveiled a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that his advisers say  would add nothing to the deficit and create 13 million jobs",MONEY; Pg. 2B,USA TODAY,"Trump win could have far-reaching impact; Plans on trade, taxes and immigration could cause anxiety",11/10/16
" for decades, movies such as i spit on your grave, thelma & louise and kill bill have stirred controversy with their depictions of female survivors of sexual assault who avenge themselves or others. it's a character arc that has pervaded pop culture in 2016, at a time when testimonies of college rape victims have rocked social media, and assault allegations against nate parker (the birth of a nation) and woody allen (cafí© society) have overshadowed their respective films. at cannes film festival this past may, dutch director paul verhoeven (basic instinct) made waves with his french-language drama elle (opens friday in new york and los angeles; expands to 16 cities nov. 18), which follows a successful businesswoman (isabelle huppert) as she tracks down her rapist. rooney mara hit the festival circuit in september with the similarly divisive una, adapted from the play blackbird, in which she stars as a woman who confronts her molester years after his crime. (michelle williams was nominated for a tony award for her performance in the  role on broadway last spring.) tv heroines on syfy's the magicians and hbo's game of thrones sought revenge on their rapists in their latest seasons, while mtv's  dark comedy sweet/vicious (premiering nov. 15, 10 p.m. et/pt) centers on two college students-turned- vigilantes (eliza bennett and taylor dearden) who beat up guys accused of sexual assault on their fictional college campus. ""it's amazing that all of these different films and television shows are being made, and they're all so different,"" says sweet/vicious creator jennifer kaytin robinson. ""we're stepping away from the after-school-special version of this story -- of being a survivor, and making it more accessible and empowering for women and men."" venturing into such sensitive terrain can be a land mine for those behind the camera. for robinson, the challenge was making a show that will educate viewers about  consent and campus rape culture, without having it ""feel like a psa,"" she says. balancing lighter  moments with more serious ones also proved tricky. the key is ""knowing when  we're dealing with assault, it is not funny and we're not exploiting it,"" robinson says. ""that's not where the comedy comes from in this show -- it comes from life."" robinson has so far received mostly positive responses from survivors, although she says some have admitted feeling ""triggered and upset"" by the level of violence in the marketing for the series. ""the show is so much more than the violence,"" robinson says. ""it's 100% heightened and is a bit of a superhero show, so there's always going to be that butt-kicking nature to it. but we're really trying to tell a story, and violence is (jules') coping mechanism."" elle prefers a more passive approach to revenge. in the opening minutes of the film, adapted from philippe djian's 2012 novel oh ..., the enigmatic michíÂle (huppert) is raped at her  paris home. because of her family's criminal past, she refuses to report the assault and instead takes matters into her own hands to uncover the identity of her attacker. michíÂle ""doesn't want to be seen as a victim and doesn't want to feel like a victim,"" verhoeven says, carrying on with life as usual immediately following the assault and only divulging vague details about it to close confidantes. verhoeven had initially conceived elle as  set in chicago but hit a roadblock when the handful of stars he approached turned down the project. ""we tend to be a little more conservative in the way that we view things, so in that sense, i would think (such depictions are) still taboo,"" says keisha hatchett, assistant editor at themarysue.com. ""we still are living in a rape culture where a guy like (former stanford university student) brock turner can get a few months in prison and you focus on his accolades as a swimmer, and you have donald trump (accused of sexual assault) and he just got elected president. people who support (them), i don't think they'll be ready"" to see rape onscreen",LIFE; Pg. 6B,USA TODAY,"'Elle,' 'Sweet/Vicious' offer controversial takes on rape revenge, survival; Big- and small-screen projects fuel dialogue around sexual assault",11/10/16

" heading into election day, most investors were stressing that gridlock in the form of having two different parties in power in the executive and legislative branches as good for markets. however, history shows the post-election consolidation of gop political power in the oval office, senate and house of representatives may turn out to be an equally bullish configuration for investors. indeed, following the 13 times since 1901 when the republican party pulled off an election hat trick -- as they did tuesday night when donald trump won the white house in dramatic fashion and the gop retained both chambers of congress -- the dow jones industrial average posted annualized gains of 8.03% and finished up 10 of 13 times, or 77% of the time, bespoke investment group data show. the only better political configurations for stocks were a democratic president and split congress, or democrat in the white house and a gop-controlled congress. stocks soared on the day after the election, with the dow rallying more than 250 points and nearing a record high after plunging 800 points in futures trading overnight. what's unique this time  is the frosty relationship between  trump and many republican lawmakers. trump, the political outsider, and more mainstream republicans may not  be in lockstep. that could give markets the benefit of full republican control as well as a healthy dose of intra-party checks and balances, analysts say. when they do agree, trump's agenda of less regulation of business, lower taxes and fiscal spending will be easier to adopt. ""there will be fewer obstacles to a path to get there,"" says brian nick, chief investment strategist at tiaa global asset management. but there will also be enough pushback from republicans to derail trump's more radical proposals on trade and immigration and call for massive tax cuts, analysts say. ""we expect the republican senate will prevent radical changes or restrictions on trade or immigration,"" david bianco, strategist at deutsche bank, wrote in a post-election report. ""the republican house will also prevent budget-busting tax cuts."" but that doesn't mean lawmakers won't help trump reduce growth-sapping regulations, slash high corporate tax rates relative to other developed nations, and allocate funds to infrastructure projects. ""this is a different type of gridlock, as it is a republican-led government but not a single-party government because trump is not really in the same party,"" argues vincent reinhart, chief economist at standish mellon, a boutique unit of bank of new york mellon, adding that the odd dynamic between trump and the party will increase the checks and balances on the new president. it's unlikely, for example, that tea party conservatives will rubber stamp trump's  tax-cut plans, which are mostly unfunded, paul ashworth, chief u.s. economist at capital economists, stressed in a report. similarly, trump would likely find resistance from his own party if he pursues ""policies that limit international trade"" or ""sour u.s. relations with its foreign allies,"" citigroup's tina fordham noted in a report",MONEY; Pg. 1B,USA TODAY,GOP sweep may be just the boost Wall St. needs,11/10/16
" but the contest for airtime, ink and clicks was a landslide for donald trump. the irresistibility of donald trump for editors, producers, bloggers and twitters dramatically shifted the election in ways that will be discussed for decades in future political communications classes. the high volumes of clicks and ratings that the president-elect generated gave way to a self-renewing cycle of free, unrelenting publicity, or ""earned media"" in industry parlance. and for a campaign that trailed its rival in fundraising and advertising buys, the ceaseless generosity from  media outlets turned out to be a huge boon for trump. from july 2015 to the end of october, trump received $5.6 billion worth of earned media, including stories, tv and radio news segments, blog posts, podcasts and social-media mentions, according to media tracking firm mediaquant. in october alone, he had $58 million of coverage. despite being the first female nominee of a major political party, hillary clinton paled in comparison, generating only $3.5 billion worth of earned media during the 15-month period. trump's closest rival during the republican primary, ted cruz, received $447 million of total earned media during the period, mediaquant says. ""we've never seen volumes of earned media that trump was able to pull together consistently from the moment he entered the race,"" says paul senatori, chief analytics officer of mediaquant. ""you can add top 20 celebrities or top 15 athletes in season, and they still won't total what trump got in a single month."" ""(clinton) was always trying to catch up to trump's earned media,"" he says. as the campaigns headed for the homestretch, clinton was able to narrow trump's lead in earned media, coming within 10%. but ""she never quite pulled it off,"" senatori said. the media understandably gravitates to newsmakers. and the former reality-tv star with an unfiltered twitter account, projecting an overt appeal to white nativism, is a story few can resist. but trump's media skills were also underestimated, says renee wilson, president of pr council, a trade group of public relations firms. ""with pr, it's all about authenticity,"" she said.

""they don't have the editorial oversight that traditional media has. they go with the sound bite."" in exploiting the free media available to him so adroitly, trump also revealed new strategies that may be employable in the future.

" jefferson. lincoln. roosevelt. roosevelt again. eisenhower. jfk. reagan. all the others. and now, donald john trump. love him or hate him, the 70-year-old new york businessman -- the oldest person ever elected to a first term as u.s. president -- has won a place in the history books. from the beginning, he was underestimated and scorned by many. he proved us wrong. i, for one, congratulate him. the plate of crow i am eating does not taste good. trump will be the leader not just of our country but of the free world. ten weeks from now, he will take the helm at a time of enormous challenge and change. our problems are many and they are complex. so are our opportunities. trump comes to the presidency with no political or legislative experience and next to no knowledge of foreign affairs. he reads little of substance, shows no curiosity and says he's smarter than generals, scientists, economists -- anyone with decades of hard-earned experience in just about any discipline. he hasn't a shred of humility and has shown himself to be as self-disciplined as an excited child tearing into his presents on christmas morning. yet on jan. 20, this man will be entrusted with making split-second, life-and-death decisions and protecting 325 million americans. in this respect, trump could not be any more different than the presidents mentioned above. of this distinction, his supporters seem neither to know nor care. but he'll soon take an oath to ""preserve, protect and defend the constitution"" -- after spending 17 months talking about watering it down in whatever ways are convenient. he'll be expected to visit the scenes of the  mass shootings, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and assorted mayhem that will surely come. he'll be expected to comfort widows and children and show empathy. if he doesn't visit a disaster scene, he'll be criticized. if he doesn't visit within a certain amount of time, he'll be criticized. if he stays only a short while, he'll be criticized. everything -- everything -- will be second-guessed. he'll be expected to show up at arlington national cemetery every memorial day, every veterans day, lay a wreath and make a solemn speech about valor and sacrifice. on the way back to the white house, he'll be expected to stop at section 60 -- final resting place for heroes from the iraq and afghanistan wars -- and hug (careful there) a grieving mom or dad. he'll be expected to travel to nearby walter reed military hospital several times a year to visit wounded servicemembers and their families. people with struggles he has never faced will bombard him with thousands of heartfelt letters and emails. some writers will complain. some will beg for help. others, lonely and afraid, write because they have nowhere else to go. past presidents have asked that some of this correspondence be given to them (president obama reads 10 personal letters a day). it helps keep them grounded and in touch with people beyond the white house bubble. trump will find that taking a few hours off to recharge -- essential for all presidents -- will be blasted by opponents. they'll ask why he isn't spending more time in the oval office doing his job. but then when he's in the oval office doing his job, they won't like the job he's doing. things will happen on the other side of the world in the middle of the night that may require immediate attention. foreign leaders who don't like us -- or him -- will try to take advantage. they'll have agendas of their own that will collide, perhaps violently, with what he wants to do. he's an impulsive, rash man who will now have to be calm and deliberate. we must wish him well. our lives, and those of our children and grandchildren, depend on it",NEWS; Pg. 13A,USA TODAY,Look who's commander in chief; Will Donald Trump rise to his moment?

" louisiana's largest parish is the reddest voting block in the country: 88.2% of voters cast their ballots for donald trump on tuesday. that percentage makes cameron  first among all counties and parishes with more than 500 people, according to usa today research. cameron parish residents are proud to hear it. at brown's food center in the heart of hackberry, a town of more than 1,200 people,  many employees were happy their candidate won the presidency and even happier that cameron parish played a role in the victory. ""it's awesome,"" said dawn abshire, a hackberry resident of 30 years. she voted for trump on tuesday for several reasons: she is against stricter gun control laws and abortion and wants to see the oil and gas industry thrive.  democratic candidate hillary clinton  wasn't an option. ""i never really cared for her,"" abshire said. on the issue of guns, abshire put it plainly: ""i want my guns. ... ""everybody has a right to defend themselves ... (and) here it's a way to fill up your freezer."" her co-worker james swire, 59, said trump's promises to bring more jobs to the usa resonated with him as his parish deals with the lasting effects of two major hurricanes in 10 years on the commercial fishing industry as well as the more recent downturn of the oil and gas industry. ""his message was that he's for the american people and he will work for us,"" swire said. geffery wooley, an engineer with chicago bridge and iron (cb&i), is not from southwest louisiana but lives there as he works on a compressed natural gas project near hackberry. he voted for trump as a resident tuesday.  he saw trump as someone who  would help the oil and gas industry. ""it's no secret the woman attempting to run for the white house was not oil and gas friendly,"" wooley said. trump's persona as an outsider with no previous experience as a politician also was appealing. ""i've been an engineer for 26 years with the oil and gas business, and i know we were tired of professional politicians,"" wooley said. ""we see somebody pushing fresh ideas forward. ""the biggest selling point (of trump) is he's not a polished liar,"" wooley said. now that the election is over, what is it that trump supporters want to see from him?

""if you were a bumblebee, hovering out at the distance of the moon, it would be able to see you,"" said john mather, a nasa astrophysicist and nobel prize winner. telescopes not only see things far away in distance, they also can look back in time because of how long it takes light from galaxies far away to reach earth. that will allow the webb telescope, using infrared wavelengths, to see the first stars and galaxies that formed about 13 billion years ago, shortly after the big bang. ""we will see things that we've never been able to see before,"" mather said. ""we are opening up a whole new territory of astronomy."" scientists will look across our galaxy for earth-like planets that could support life, as well as study the evolution of our solar system. the shiny new telescope's predecessor, the 26-year-old hubble that orbits earth, will continue to send back fascinating and awe-inspiring images from outer space even after the webb is in place. the hubble will retain a distinct advantage over webb -- nasa can send manned missions to repair or upgrade it because of its close proximity to earth. once the webb is in place, nasa doesn't plan to send humans in for any repairs. nasa administrator charles bolden unveiled the webb's gigantic gold-coated mirror -- actually 18 smaller mirrors attached together -- at the  goddard space flight center in maryland. he called the telescope a ""milestone"" in space observation, one that was a long time coming",NEWS; Pg. 11A,USA TODAY,"Most powerful telescope to peer back to beginning; Hubble successor, nearing completion, will launch in 2018",11/10/16
