Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

**1 Exxon Mobil Corporation appeals from the district court’s partial grant of summary judgment in favor of Laurance Brooks, Jr. The district court entered judgment declaring that under a lease agreement between the parties Exxon Mobil is obligated to replace a building that it removed from property owned by Brooks. Exxon Mobil argues that the district court erroneously granted the declaratory judgment because Brooks failed to request such relief in his complaint and because the lease agreement permits Exxon Mobil to remove the building at issue without replacing it.
 
This court reviews a district court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court. Caboni v. General Motors Corp., 278 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2002). Following a thorough review of the record and the briefs, we affirm the judgment for essentially the reasons given by the district court.
 
AFFIRMED.
