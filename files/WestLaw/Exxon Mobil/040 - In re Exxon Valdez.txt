MEMORANDUM1
*1 Cook Inlet Processors and Nautilus Marine Enterprises appeal the district court’s approval of a seafood processor plan of distribution, which excluded them from recovering a portion of the $5 billion punitive damage verdict against Exxon for the Valdez oil spill. The plan excluded the processors on the basis of settlement agreements they both signed, which contained full punitive damage releases. We review the district court’s approval of a plan of distribution for an abuse of discretion, In re Exxon Valdez, 229 F.3d 790, 795 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.
 
Cook Inlet’s settlement agreement released Exxon from “all punitive damage claims of any kind arising at any time.” Similarly, Nautilus Marine’s settlement agreement released Exxon from “any and all claims for punitive damages in any way associated with [the Valdez spill].” The district court did not abuse its discretion when it approved the plan which excluded the processors from punitive damage recovery based on the release language.
 
The processors’ arguments for invalidating the releases on the grounds of economic duress and waiver also fail. The processors presented no evidence to support setting aside the releases on the basis of economic duress. Exxon did not waive the releases by failing to plead them as affirmative defenses because the complaints did not request punitive damages.2
 
AFFIRMED.
