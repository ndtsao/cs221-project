Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

*1 Barbara M. Jackson, a current ExxonMobil employee who has worked in an administrative/clerical role for the company since 1980, asserts racial discrimination and retaliation claims against ExxonMobil for violations of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Ms. Jackson complains of approximately 33 separate employment actions. Her complaints can be generally categorized as claims for (i) job erosion; (ii) elimination of overtime; (iii) attendance, performance, and miscellaneous issues; and (iv) failure to transfer or promote her to other jobs on numerous occasions.
 
The district court granted summary judgment in favor of ExxonMobil on all Jackson’s claims. Ms. Jackson appealed the district court’s rulings.
 
After considering the record excerpts and briefs, we hereby AFFIRM for the reasons stated by the district court in its summary judgment orders of May 16 and August 21, 2001.
 
AFFIRMED.
