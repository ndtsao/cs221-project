FURTHER ORDERED and ADJUDGED that in light of Kiobel and Perisic, the dismissal of the Alien Tort Statute claims be remanded to the District Court for further consideration. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED and ADJUDGED in accordance with this court’s opinion issued July 8, 2011, that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed as to the dismissal of appellants’ Torture Victim Protection Act claims and be reversed as to the dismissal of appellants’ non-federal tort claims (Parts IV & VI of the opinion).
