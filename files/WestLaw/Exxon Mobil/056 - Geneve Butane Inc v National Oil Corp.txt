Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

Plaintiff Geneve Butane appeals the district court’s denial of its request for additional discovery, the dismissal of its Supplemental Rule B proceeding, and the vacatur of its order of attachment. We review the district court’s order vacating the maritime attachment and dismissing the proceeding for an abuse of discretion, though the legal conclusions underlying the order are reviewed de novo.1 We review the denial of the request for additional discovery for an abuse of discretion.2
 
The parties are familiar with the facts of this case. After considering the district court’s decision, the briefing, and the oral arguments, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in vacating the attachment and dismissing the proceeding without prejudice. We also conclude *186 that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Geneve additional discovery. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
