PER CURIAM:

Oleg G. Podgoretsky appeals the district court’s order dismissing his civil complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. Podgoretsky v. Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, No. 1:14–cv–00239–AJT–IDD (E.D.Va. Aug. 20, 2014). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED.
