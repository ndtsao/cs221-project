ORDER
*1 The following are before the court:
1. EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY APPEAL BOND, filed on November 30, 2015, by counsel for the appellant.
2. RESPONSE TO OBJECTOR ROBERT BURACK’S EMERGENCY MOTION TO STAY APPEAL BOND, filed on December 3, 2015, by counsel for the appellee.
3. REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO STAY APPEAL BOND, filed on December 3, 2015, by counsel for the appellant.
 
IT IS ORDERED that the motion to stay the existing appeal bond of $121,886 pending appeal is GRANTED to the extent that we modify the amount of that bond to $5,000. The parties may address the appropriateness of the bond in their merits briefs. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 7 refers specifically and only to “a bond ... necessary to ensure payment of costs on appeal.” Special problems related to abuse by class action objectors must be handled in other ways, primarily through a motion under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 for sanctions.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in the interest of prompt resolution of the appeal, no extensions to the briefing schedule will be granted.
