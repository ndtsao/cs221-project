[Unpublished]
PER CURIAM.
James F. Boschert appeals the district court’s1 dismissal of his diversity action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We agree with the district court that dismissal for failure to state a claim was warranted, see Mountain Home Flight Serv., Inc. v. Baxter Cnty., Ark., 758 F.3d 1038, 1042–43 (8th Cir.2014) (de novo review), and we find no merit to Boschert’s objections to the no-argument designation of the instant appeal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.
