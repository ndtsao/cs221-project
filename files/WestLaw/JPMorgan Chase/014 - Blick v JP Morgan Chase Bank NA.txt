Opinion
Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

**1 Kathleen and Harold Blick appeal the district court’s order granting Defendants’ Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss their action to quiet title in real property. We have reviewed the record and find no *853 reversible error in the district court’s rejection of their claim that Defendants lacked standing to foreclose on the property. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of this claim for the reasons stated by the district court. Blick v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 3:12–cv–00001–NKM–BWC, 2012 WL 1030115 (W.D.Va. Mar. 27, 2012). Turning to the Blicks’ remaining claims, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellants’ brief. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because the Blicks fail to challenge the court’s resolution of these claims, they have forfeited appellate review of those issues. We therefore affirm the court’s denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED.
