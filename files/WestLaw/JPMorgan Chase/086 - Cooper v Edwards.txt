*248 PER CURIAM:

Milford George Cooper appeals the district court’s order dismissing his civil complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) (2012). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. Cooper v. Edwards, No. 5:13–cv–00711–D (E.D.N.C. Dec. 5, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED.
