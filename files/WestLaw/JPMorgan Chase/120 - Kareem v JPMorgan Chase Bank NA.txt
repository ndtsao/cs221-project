ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
Before: SUHRHEINRICH, SILER, and COOK, Circuit Judges.


ORDER
*1 Hussain Kareem, a Georgia resident, appeals pro se the dismissal of his action challenging a foreclosure on real property. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
 
In March 2014, Kareem filed his original complaint against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) alleging claims under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. § 2605 et seq. Kareem alleged that he had refinanced his mortgage through Washington Mutual Bank, FA (WaMu) on real property located in Georgia in 2007, and had rescinded the loan in 2008, but that WaMu had nevertheless foreclosed on the property soon thereafter. WaMu was then placed in receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and, in September 2008, Chase acquired certain of WaMu’s loans, including Kareem’s loan. Chase subsequently attempted to gain possession of the real property, claiming to be the successor-in-interest to WaMu, although Kareem disputed this claim.
 
Chase moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and Kareem responded. The district court granted the motion, but permitted Kareem to file an amended complaint. In the amended complaint, Kareem raised claims of (1) trespass, (2) violation of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act (GFBPA), and (3) violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and sought a declaratory judgment. Chase moved to dismiss this complaint as well, and Kareem filed a response. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and subsequently denied Kareem’s motion for reconsideration and a new trial.
 
On appeal, Kareem argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaints for failure to state a claim, his motion to file a second amended complaint was erroneously denied, he was denied discovery, the district court did not review the documents attached to the complaint, he was entitled to declaratory relief, and the district court erred in denying the motion for reconsideration.
 
[1]A complaint is properly dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) when it does not contain sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). The district court dismissed Kareem’s claims in his original complaint under the TILA and FDCPA because they were barred by a one-year statute of limitations, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 1640(e), 1692k(d), where the foreclosure took place in 2008 and the complaint was not filed until 2014. Kareem does not challenge this conclusion in his brief and has therefore waived this issue. See Marks v. Newcourt Credit Grp., Inc., 342 F.3d 444, 462 (6th Cir. 2003). The district court dismissed the claim under the RESPA because Kareem presented no evidence of damages arising from the alleged failure to respond to his qualified written requests sent years after the foreclosure was complete. Kareem states that he disagrees with this holding, but points to no evidence in support.
 
*2 The district court dismissed Kareem’s claim for trespass in his amended complaint for failure to state a claim under Georgia law, see Udoinyion v. Re/Max of Atlanta, 657 S.E.2d 644, 648 (Ga. Ct. App. 2008). Kareem presents no argument against this conclusion on appeal. Similarly, he points to no error in the district court’s conclusion that the GFBPA does not apply to foreclosures because they are heavily regulated by other state and federal agencies and statutes, Stewart v. Suntrust Mortg., Inc., 770 S.E.2d 892, 898 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015), and that there is no private cause of action for inaccurate reporting under the FCRA, and no evidence of a notice of dispute from a credit reporting agency.
 
[2]Kareem argues in his brief that the district court erred in denying his motion to file a second amended complaint, but has not shown that an amendment would not be futile. See Miller v. Calhoun Cty., 408 F.3d 803, 817 (6th Cir. 2005). He also challenges the district court’s denial of his motion to compel discovery. A court has the discretion to stay discovery until questions that may dispose of the case, including a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, are determined. See Hahn v. Star Bank, 190 F.3d 708, 719 (6th Cir. 1999). A discovery ruling will be reversed only if it affected substantial rights and amounted to more than harmless error. Dortch v. Fowler, 588 F.3d 396, 400 (6th Cir. 2009). Kareem has not demonstrated that any requested discovery would have altered the district court’s rulings discussed above.
 
[3]Kareem’s claim that the district court did not review the documents attached to his complaint is contradicted by a reading of the district court’s opinions, which reference the attached exhibits on several occasions. Kareem complains that he is entitled to a declaratory judgment stating that he has valid defenses under Georgia law to any future action by Chase to gain possession of the real estate. No error is apparent in the district court’s determination that such a decision should be left to the state courts in the event Chase resorts to a state action. See Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Roumph, 211 F.3d 964, 968 (6th Cir. 2000). Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Kareem’s motion for reconsideration because he demonstrated no clear error, new evidence, change in law, or manifest injustice. See Intera Corp. v. Henderson, 428 F.3d 605, 619 (6th Cir. 2005).
 
For all of the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.
