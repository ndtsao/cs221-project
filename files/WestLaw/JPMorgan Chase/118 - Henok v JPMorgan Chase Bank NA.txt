ORDER
PER CURIAM.
*1 Upon consideration of the motion to dismiss appeal as to Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), construed as a motion for summary affirmance as to Fannie Mae, and the response thereto, it is
 
ORDERED that the motion for summary affirmance be granted as to appellee Fannie Mae. The merits of the parties’ positions are so clear as to warrant summary action. See Taxpayers Watchdog, Inc. v. Stanley, 819 F.2d 294, 297 (D.C.Cir.1987) (per curiam). The district court properly dismissed the complaint as to Fannie Mae, because the record shows Fannie Mae did not purchase appellant’s property at the foreclosure sale, and Fannie Mae was erroneously named as a defendant in the complaint.
 
Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until resolution of the remainder of the appeal. The Clerk is also directed to enter a briefing schedule for the remaining parties.
