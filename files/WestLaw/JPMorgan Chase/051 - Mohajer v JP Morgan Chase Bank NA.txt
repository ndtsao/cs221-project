MEMORANDUM**
Masoumeh Mohajer appeals pro se from the district court’s judgment dismissing her action alleging federal and state law claims arising from foreclosure proceedings. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm.
 
We do not consider Mohajer’s federal and state law claims arising from foreclosure proceedings because Mohajer does not challenge the district court’s dismissal of those claims in her opening brief. See Padgett v. Wright, 587 F.3d 983, 985 n.2 (9th Cir. 2009) (court does not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief).
 
We reject as unsupported by the record Mohajer’s contention that opposing counsel filed a proposed order with the district court without a certificate of service.
 
Defendants’ September 11, 2015 motion for judicial notice is denied as unnecessary.
 
AFFIRMED.
