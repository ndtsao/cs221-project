Harry Joseph Philips, Jr., Taylor, Porter, Brooks & Phillips, Baton Rouge, LA, for Defendant-Appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, USDC No. 6:05-CV-1304.
Before JOLLY, DENNIS, and PRADO, Circuit Judges.
Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

*1 Sandra and Mark Curley appeal the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA. The district court found that the Curleys could not prove a prima facie case of discrimination to support their claim under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691. The court also found no issue of material fact to support the Curleys’ claims arising under 12 C.F.R. § 202.9.
 
After review of the record, the evidence, and the briefs there appears to be no reversible error committed by the district court. Consequently, the district court’s judgment is
 
AFFIRMED.
