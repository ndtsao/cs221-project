PER CURIAM:*

**1 Carolyn Teltschik appeals the district court’s judgment dismissing her action against JP Morgan Chase & Co., Chase Bank USA NA, and JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, and its order refusing to remand the case to state court.

For the reasons *879 stated by the district court in its Memorandum Opinion and Order of September 12, 2006, 2006 WL 2620515, and in its Order entered August 15, 2006, we affirm the district court’s final judgment.
 
AFFIRMED.
