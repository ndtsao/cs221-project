ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN
Attorneys and Law Firms
Robert L. Adams, Pro se.
David M. George, Alison L. Carruthers, Dykema Gossett, Ann Arbor, MI, for Defendant–Appellee.
Before: SUHRHEINRICH, MOORE, and COOK, Circuit Judges.


ORDER
*1 Robert Adams, a Michigan resident proceeding pro se, appeals the district court’s dismissal of his amended complaint, which raised numerous claims challenging the foreclosure of his residential property in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
 
In August 2004, Adams obtained a loan from Washington Mutual Bank, F.A. (“WaMu Bank”) to refinance the mortgage on his home. He made payments on the loan for less than one year. Due to the default, WaMu Bank commenced a foreclosure by advertisement and purchased the property at a sheriff’s sale on May 4, 2006. Adams failed to redeem the property or challenge the foreclosure during the statutory redemption period.
 
Adams remained in the property, and, in November 2006, WaMu Bank commenced an action in state court to recover possession of the property, pursuant to Michigan’s Summary Proceedings Act, Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.5107-600.5709. In 2008, while that action was pending, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase”) acquired ownership of the property when it purchased certain assets of WaMu Bank, which had been declared insolvent. Later that year, the state court entered a judgment awarding WaMu Bank possession of the property. On January 6, 2010, the state circuit court reversed that judgment on appeal.
 
After failed settlement negotiations with Adams, Chase commenced another summary proceeding in state court to recover possession of the property. On August 28, 2013, Chase recorded a quitclaim deed relating to the transfer of the property from the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (“FDIC”) as receiver for WaMu Bank to Chase. On December 2, 2013, the trial court granted Chase possession of the property, holding that there was no “defect in the foreclosure process” and, because Adams “failed to redeem the property during the redemption period ... the Sheriff’s Deed became operative and vested all rights, title, and interest to [Chase.]” The court explained that the reversal of the previous judgment in the 2006 action was based “on an evidentiary issue—no opinion regarding the validity of the foreclosure was issued—the original eviction action was dismissed without prejudice.” Adams unsuccessfully appealed the judgment.
 
While Adams was seeking leave to appeal, Chase commenced eviction proceedings in state court, and, on August 5, 2015, an order of eviction was entered. Adams unsuccessfully appealed that order. According to Adams, in May 2015, Chase sent an individual, unaccompanied by a sheriff or officer of the court authorized to execute the eviction order, to change the locks on the home.
 
On August 7, 2015, two days after entry of the eviction order, Adams, represented by counsel, commenced this action in the district court against Chase and the FDIC in its capacity as receiver for WaMu Bank, challenging the same foreclosure and eviction that was the subject of the state court proceedings. Adams’s first amended complaint raised the following thirteen counts: (1) “Violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” (“FDCPA”); (2) “Quiet Title”; (3) “False Encumbrance of Title and Notice of Claim”; (4) “Statutory and Common Law Slander of Title”; (5) “Unlawful Eviction and Interference with Possessory Interest”; (6) “Unlawful Entry and Trespass”; (7) “Unlawful Constructive Eviction”; (8) “Fraud”; (9) “Abuse of Process”; (10) “Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (against FDIC); (11) “Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (against Chase); (12) “Violation of Due Process Guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment”; and (13) “Due Process Violation.” Chase moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Adams’s claims were barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, see D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923), and by res judicata and collateral estoppel. Additionally, Chase argued that none of the thirteen counts alleged a plausible claim for relief. In his response to the motion, Adams withdrew his slander claim (claim four). The district court granted Chase’s motion to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that claims two, three, five, eight, nine, eleven, twelve, and thirteen were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel and that claims one, five, six, seven, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted.
 
*2 Adams now appeals pro se. He challenges the district court’s rulings on only claims one through three, five, seven, and nine. His remaining claims are therefore deemed abandoned. See United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 845-46 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
We review a dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo. City of Columbus, Ohio v. Hotels.com, L.P., 693 F.3d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 2012). A complaint survives a motion to dismiss only if it “contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ ” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.” Id. at 679.
 
[1]Counts two, three, five, and nine of the first amended complaint alleged, respectively, that the quitclaim deed that Chase recorded in 2013 “constitute[d] an unlawful cloud on ... Adams’s title to [the] home and wrongfully impair[ed] [his] ability to refinance or sell his home”; that Chase filed the quitclaim deed for the purpose of slandering title to Adams’s home, in violation of Michigan Compiled Laws § 565.108; that, through the changing of the locks on the home by one not authorized to execute an eviction order, Chase unlawfully interfered with Adams’s possessory interest in the home; and that Chase commenced the 2013 action to recover possession of the property “knowing that the 2006 foreclosure for advertisement, Sheriff’s Sale and Sheriff’s Deed had been invalidated pursuant to the January 6, 2010 [circuit court] order.” Underlying each of these claims was Adams’s assertion that he held lawful title to the property and therefore had a right to possession.
 
The district court properly held that, in light of the state trial court’s December 2, 2013 order, many of Adams’s claims, including claims two, three, five, and nine, were barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Michigan law governs whether a federal court affords preclusive effect to a Michigan state judgment. See, e.g., Buck v. Thomas M. Cooley Law Sch., 597 F.3d 812, 816-17 (6th Cir. 2010). Michigan recognizes two preclusion doctrines: res judicata (or claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (or issue preclusion). Claim preclusion “bars a second, subsequent action when (1) the prior action was decided on the merits, (2) both actions involve the same parties or their privies, and (3) the matter in the second case was, or could have been, resolved in the first.” Adair v. State, 680 N.W.2d 386, 396 (Mich. 2004). Michigan, however, recognizes a statutory exception to the broad application of the res judicata doctrine when the first action is a summary proceeding, like that brought by Chase in 2013. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.5750; J.A.M. Corp. v. AARO Disposal, Inc., 600 N.W.2d 617, 621-22. (Mich. 1999). In J.A.M. Corp., the Michigan Supreme Court held that a “judgment in these summary proceedings, no matter who prevails, does not bar other claims for relief.” Id. In Sewell v. Clean Cut Management, Inc., 621 N.W.2d 222, 224-25 (Mich. 2001), the court clarified that the exception to the res judicata bar for “other claims for relief” applies only to “those claims that ‘could have been’ brought during the summary proceedings, but were not.” The J.A.M. Corp. court “was not describing subsequent claims involving the issues actually litigated in the summary proceedings.” Id.
 
*3 Adams argues that his claims fall within the exception to the res judicata bar discussed in J.A.M. Corp because he is “not re-litigating what the state district court already determined—he is alleging new claims that were not, and could not have been brought before the district court during the summary proceedings.” But claims two, three, five, and nine were all premised on Adams’s assertion that he was entitled to possession of the property—the very issue that was “actually litigated in the summary proceeding[ ]” and decided by the state court in its December 2, 2013 order granting possession to Chase on the merits. Sewell, 621 N.W.2d at 225. And, to the extent Adams argues that the 2013 order cannot serve to bar his claims because the state court failed to give preclusive effect to the previous decision in the 2006 summary proceeding, the state court made clear that the previous judgment did not preclude Chase’s claim for possession because the reversal of that judgment was on an evidentiary issue and resulted in a dismissal without prejudice. Because all three elements of res judicata are present, the district court properly held that claims two, three, five, and nine were barred. See Richardson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 2:13-CV-13-10234-GAD, 2013 WL 3814275, at *4-5 (E.D. Mich. July 22, 2013).
 
[2]For the same reasons, the district court also properly concluded that these four claims were barred by collateral estoppel. All of the elements for collateral estoppel are present here: the parties in both the summary proceeding and this case are identical; the state district court’s judgment in the summary proceeding became final after Adams’s unsuccessful appeals; the issue of who had a right to possession of the property was actually litigated in the summary proceeding; and Adams had a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue in the summary proceeding. See Darrah v. City of Oak Park, 255 F.3d 301, 311 (6th Cir. 2001).
 
Adams argues that collateral estoppel does not apply because the issue of title was never litigated in the summary proceeding. This argument is unavailing. In its December 2, 2013 order, the state district court expressly held that Adams “failed to redeem the property during the redemption period, and as a result the Sheriff’s Deed became operative and vested all rights, title, and interest to [Chase].” (emphasis added). Indeed, the Michigan Court of Appeals has rejected this argument in similar cases, explaining that “some possession judgments are necessarily predicated on an underlying title determination,” such as when “the right of possession by [the plaintiff in the summary proceeding] was dependent on ... legal title on the basis of expiration of the redemption period absent redemption.” Johnston v. Sterling Mortg. & Inv. Co., ––– N.W.2d ––––, Nos. 324855, 325238, 2016 WL 1038274 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 15, 2016) (quoting Bank of Am. v. 5-3 Greenway Tr., No. 3204043, 2015 WL 9392725, at *6 (Mich. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2015)) (per curiam). Here, the state court’s possession determination necessarily resolved the issue of title.
 
[3]Adams also challenges on appeal the district court’s determination that he failed to state a claim for relief in counts one, five, and seven. Count one of the first amended complaint alleged that the defendants violated the FDCPA by changing the locks on the home. “The FDCPA was enacted to ‘eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.’ ” Montgomery v. Huntington Bank, 346 F.3d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e)). While “mortgage foreclosure is debt collection under the FDCPA,” Glazer v. Chase Home Fin. LLC, 704 F.3d 453, 461 (6th Cir. 2013), eviction proceedings do not constitute debt collection, see Bobo v. Trott & Trott, P.C., No. 13-14696, 2014 WL 555201, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 12, 2014); Bond v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, No. 09-14541, 2010 WL 1265852, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 29, 2010); Burks v. Wash. Mut. Bank, No. 07-13693, 2008 WL 4966656, at *9 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 17, 2008). Because the conduct of which Adams complained—changing the locks—was taken after the foreclosure and the summary proceeding had concluded and was undertaken as part of the eviction of Adams from the property, it was not debt collection and therefore does not fall within the ambit of the FDCPA. Count one was appropriately dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief.
 
*4 [4]The district court also properly dismissed for failure to state a claim counts five and seven, which alleged unlawful eviction and interference with possessory interest, under Michigan Compiled Laws § 600.2918(1) and (2), and unlawful constructive eviction. Again, these claims challenge Chase’s conduct in changing the locks on the home. Section 600.2918(1) allows for an award of damages, in addition to recovery of possession, to “[a]ny person who is ejected or put out of any lands or tenements in a forcible and unlawful manner, or being out is afterwards held and kept out, by force.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2918(1). Because Adams did not allege that Chase used or threatened the use of force against a person for the purpose of expelling him from the property, he failed to state a claim under § 600.2918(1). See Mier v. Zimmerman, No. 273312, 2008 WL 681158, at *3 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2008).
 
Subsection (2) of that statute allows “any tenant in possession of premises whose possessory interest has been unlawfully interfered with by the owner” to recover damages and possession. Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2918(2). The district court concluded that Adams failed to state a claim under this provision because he was not a “tenant,” which is defined as “the individual or individuals who pay consideration to the landlord for the right to occupy rental property.” Eberline v. Nat’l City Mortg., Inc., No. 292022, 2011 WL 3209215, at *4 (Mich. Ct. App. July 28, 2011). For the same reason, the district court held that Adams failed to state a claim for unlawful constructive eviction in count seven. “Constructive eviction is defined as a landlord’s act which deprives the tenant of beneficial enjoyment of the premises to which he is entitled under the lease, causing the tenant to abandon the premises.” Briarwood v. Faber’s Fabrics, Inc., 415 N.W.2d 310, 313 n.2 (Mich. Ct. App. 1987).
 
Adams argues that the district court improperly determined that he was not a tenant because, under Michigan law, “a mortgagor terminated by foreclosure is a tenant by sufferance.” The case on which Adams relies, Allen v. Carpenter, 15 Mich. 25, 34 (Mich. 1866), defines a tenant at sufferance as “one who, having come into possession by right, holds over without right”; the definition includes a “mortgagor whose estate has been terminated by foreclosure proceedings.” But “the defining element of a tenancy by sufferance is the passive acquiescence by the property owner.” United States v. Hunyady, 409 F.3d 297, 301 (6th Cir. 2005). Here, at the time of the lock-out, there was no passive acquiescence on the part of Chase; Chase had obtained a judgment of possession against Adams in the summary proceedings and had commenced an eviction proceeding. Thus, even assuming that there had been a tenancy by sufferance at some point, Adams was a trespasser, not a tenant, at the time of the lock-out. See Mills v. Cty. of Lapeer, 498 Fed.Appx. 507, 512 (6th Cir. 2012); see also Allen, 15 Mich. at 42 (“[A] tenant at sufferance is not a trespasser, unless he attempts to hold over after the landlord re-enters and terminates that peculiar occupancy.”) (Campbell J., concurring). Claim seven was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim.
 
Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.
