Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Virginia A. Phillips, District Judge, Presiding. D.C. No. 5:08-cv-00177-VAP-JCR.
Before: FERNANDEZ, GOULD, and M. SMITH, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM**
**1 Adaku E. Eronini appeals pro se from the district court’s order dismissing for failure to state a claim her action alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (“RESPA”), 12 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., and California state law. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo. Miller v. Yokohama Tire Corp., 358 F.3d 616, 619 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.
 
*842 The district court properly dismissed the action because Eronini suffered no damages as a result of the alleged RESPA violation. See 12 U.S.C. § 2605(f)(1)(A) (allowing recovery of “actual damages”). We do not consider arguments that Eronini presented for the first time on appeal. See Turnacliff v. Westly, 546 F.3d 1113, 1120 (9th Cir.2008).
 
Eronini’s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.
 
AFFIRMED.
