ORDER
*1 Upon a review of the record and the responses to the court’s October 25, 2016 order, we conclude this appeal is frivolous. We therefore deny appellant’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (Docket Entry No. 13), see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), and dismiss this appeal as frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) (court shall dismiss case at any time, if court determines it is frivolous or malicious).
 
DISMISSED.
