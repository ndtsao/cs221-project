Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, No. 1:12–CV–398.
Before SMITH, PRADO, and HIGGINSON, Circuit Judges.
Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

Janos Farkas, pro se, appeals the dismissal, for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), of his suit challenging a foreclosure. In a concise but thorough Order filed June 22, 2012, the district court carefully explained why there is no merit to the claim.
 
The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons given by the district court. As for Farkas’s claim that removal was improper for want of diversity of citizenship, we agree with defendant that the joinder of the second defendant was fraudulent and in an attempt to defeat diversity in that there was no colorable cause of action against that defendant.
