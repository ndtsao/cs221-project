PER CURIAM.
*1 The Defendants1 seek review of the district court’s order remanding this action to state court pursuant to the court’s discretionary abstention power under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(c)(1). The Retirement Systems of Alabama (“RSA”) filed suit against the Defendants based on their alleged involvement in, or culpable knowledge of, the events and transactions that led to WorldCom Corporation’s bankruptcy. Some of the Defendants filed a timely notice of removal to federal district court based on 28 U.S.C. § 1452(a), but the district court exercised its discretionary abstention power under § 1334(c)(1) and granted RSA’s Motion to Remand or to Abstain.
 
On appeal, RSA contends that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the court’s abstention decision based on the statutory bars to appellate review contained in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(d) and 1452(b). In response, the Defendants contend that the statutory bars in §§ 1334(d) and 1452(b) are unconstitutional and that this court has jurisdiction to evaluate the constitutionality of these statutes. Based on their argument that the statutory bars to appellate review are unconstitutional, the Defendants contend that this court has jurisdiction to review the district court’s abstention order and they urge this court to hold that the district court’s order constitutes an abuse of discretion. The United States has intervened to defend the constitutionality of §§ 1334(d) and 1452(b).
 
We have jurisdiction to evaluate the constitutionality of §§ 1334(d) and 1452(b). See, e.g., Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 661, 665, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 2339, 2341, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996) (dismissing for want of jurisdiction after rejecting a constitutional challenge brought on Article III, § 2, Exceptions Clause grounds); see also United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (noting that a federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction). Having carefully reviewed the briefs submitted by RSA, the Defendants, and the United States, we conclude that the statutory bars to appellate review contained in §§ 1334(d) and 1452(b) are constitutional. Ex Parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506, 513-14, 19 L.Ed. 264 (1869); Ex Parte Yerger, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 85, 104, 19 L.Ed. 332 (1870). As a result, we lack jurisdiction to consider the Defendants’ argument that the district court abused its discretion when it exercised its discretionary abstention power under § 1334(c)(1) and remanded the action to state court.2
 
DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.
