ORDER
*1 Leatrice Y. Johnson El and King Morpheus El, Michigan litigants proceeding pro se, appeal the district court’s order dismissing their complaint arising out of a mortgage loan and subsequent foreclosure and eviction proceedings. This case has been referred to a panel of the court that, upon examination, unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).
 
In March 2006, the plaintiffs received a loan from Choice Mortgage Co. (Choice) in the amount of $121,495.00. The loan was secured by a mortgage on property located at 514 Bay Street, Pontiac, Michigan, which was granted to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for Choice. MERS assigned the mortgage to JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association (Chase), via an assignment of mortgage recorded on April 16, 2012. Effective October 1, 2012, the plaintiffs entered into a loan modification agreement with Chase. The plaintiffs subsequently defaulted on the loan modification agreement, and Chase initiated foreclosure proceedings. After publication and posting of the notice of foreclosure, a sheriff’s sale was held on January 7, 2014. Chase was the highest bidder. Upon expiration of the statutory redemption period, Chase initiated summary proceedings against the plaintiffs in the 50th Judicial District of the State of Michigan, seeking a judgment of possession. On December 1, 2014, the district court entered default judgment in favor of Chase. The plaintiffs filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, which was denied. The plaintiffs then filed an appeal, which the Oakland County Circuit Court dismissed. After a hearing on June 22, 2015, the district court entered an order of eviction. The Oakland County Circuit Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ subsequent appeal.
 
On November 10, 2015, the plaintiffs filed this complaint against Chase and its legal counsel during the foreclosure and eviction proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged that Choice failed to provide required disclosures and that they sent notice of rescission to Chase Home Finance LLC on February 28, 2007, and to Choice on January 3, 2008. The plaintiffs asserted twelve causes of action: (1) negligence, (2) commercial fraud, (3) violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z, (4) violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), (5) violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), (6) setting aside the sheriff’s sale, (7) wrongful foreclosure, (8) unjust enrichment, (9) violation of the Michigan Business and Professions Code, (10) quiet title, (11) slander of title, and (12) violation of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act.
 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims. A magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the motions to dismiss and dismiss the complaint. The magistrate judge concluded that the plaintiffs’ claims regarding the foreclosure process were barred by the Rooker–Feldman doctrine, that their claims for negligence and fraud were barred by the economic loss doctrine, that their claims for violations of TILA and FDCPA were time barred, and that they failed to state a plausible claim for relief for violations of the FCRA, the Michigan Business and Professions Code, and the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act. Overruling the plaintiffs’ objections, the district court modified and adopted the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss, and dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice. This timely appeal followed.
 
*2 The plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge’s recommendations that their claim under TILA and Regulation Z be dismissed as time barred and that their claims regarding the foreclosure process be dismissed as barred by the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. They did not articulate any specific objections to the dismissal of their other claims. “[O]nly those specific objections to the magistrate judge’s report made to the district court will be preserved for appellate review; making some objections but failing to raise others will not preserve all the objections a party may have.” Smith v. Detroit Fed’n of Teachers Local 231, 829 F.2d 1370, 1373 (6th Cir. 1987). By failing to raise specific objections to the magistrate judge’s recommendations as to their other claims, the plaintiffs have waived appellate review of their dismissal.
 
We review de novo the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Thompson v. Bank of Am., N.A., 773 F.3d 741, 750 (6th Cir. 2014). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ ” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).
 
The plaintiffs argued that they stated a valid claim for declaratory relief under TILA and Regulation Z because they timely exercised their right of rescission. The plaintiffs alleged that they sent notice of rescission to Chase Home Finance LLC on February 28, 2007, and to Choice on January 3, 2008, within the three-year period under 15 U.S.C. § 1635(f). Citing Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 790 (2015), and Paatalo v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 146 F. Supp. 3d 1239 (D. Or. 2015), the plaintiffs asserted that the rescission was effective upon mailing their notice and that the subsequent foreclosure procedure was therefore invalid. After the purported rescission, however, the plaintiffs entered into another agreement with Chase—the loan modification agreement. As the district court properly held, the plaintiffs’ loan modification agreement, in which they specifically reaffirmed the mortgage and note, nullified any rescission.
 
To the extent that the plaintiffs asserted a damages claim based on Choice’s alleged failure to provide the disclosures required under TILA, the district court correctly dismissed that claim as barred by the one-year statute of limitations. See 15 U.S.C. § 1640(e); Coyer v. HSBC Mortg. Servs., Inc., 701 F.3d 1104, 1109 (6th Cir. 2012). The district court further determined that the plaintiffs were not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period, considering the following factors: “(1) lack of actual notice of filing requirement; (2) lack of constructive knowledge of filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing one’s rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant; and (5) a plaintiff’s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement.” Andrews v. Orr, 851 F.2d 146, 151 (6th Cir. 1988). The plaintiffs’ knowledge of their rescission rights under TILA suggested at least constructive notice of the filing requirement. The plaintiffs attempted to rescind the loan in 2007 and 2008 but waited until 2015 to file their lawsuit, indicating a lack of diligence. As the district court noted, the defendants would be prejudiced by defending against a nearly decade-old claim based on a loan that had already been foreclosed upon. The district court did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs’ TILA claim as time barred.
 
We review de novo the district court’s application of the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. Hall v. Callahan, 727 F.3d 450, 453 (6th Cir. 2013). Under that doctrine, federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state-court judgments. See D.C. Ct. of App. v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Tr. Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415–16 (1923). The Supreme Court has explained that the Rooker–Feldman doctrine applies to “cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 284 (2005).
 
*3 The district court concluded that, under the Rooker–Feldman doctrine, it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims for setting aside the foreclosure sale, wrongful foreclosure, unjust enrichment, quiet title, and slander of title because those claims stemmed from the state-court’s judgment in favor of Chase in the foreclosure and eviction proceedings. The plaintiffs argued that the Rooker–Feldman doctrine did not apply because they had no “reasonable opportunity” to raise their federal claims in state court. See Goodman v. Sipos, 259 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir. 2001); Powell v. Powell, 80 F.3d 464, 467 (11th Cir. 1996). But these claims are state-law claims. Furthermore, this court has declined to adopt the “reasonable opportunity” exception to the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. Abbott v. Michigan, 474 F.3d 324, 330 (6th Cir. 2007). The district court properly dismissed these claims as barred by the Rooker–Feldman doctrine. See Givens v. Homecomings Fin., 278 Fed.Appx. 607, 608–09 (6th Cir. 2008); Kafele v. Lerner, Sampson & Rothfuss, L.P.A., 161 Fed.Appx. 487, 489–90 (6th Cir. 2005).
 
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal order.
