ORDER
PER CURIAM.
*1 Upon consideration of the motion for summary affirmance, the court’s December 15, 2014 order to show cause why the motion for summary affirmance should not be considered and decided without a response, and the response thereto; the motion for leave to file a document under seal; the motion to expedite, the motion for leave to file ex parte a supplement to the motion to expedite, and the proposed supplement, it is
 
ORDERED that the order to show cause be discharged. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for summary affirmance be granted. The merits of the parties’ positions are so clear as to warrant summary action. See Taxpayers Watchdog, Inc. v. Stanley, 819 F.2d 294, 297 (D.C.Cir.1987) (per curiam). Appellant has identified no error in the district court’s dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that it is “ ‘patently insubstantial,’ presenting no federal question suitable for decision.” Tooley v. Napolitano, 586 F.3d 1006, 1009 (D.C.Cir.2009) (quoting Best v. Kelly, 39 F.3d 328, 330 (D.C.Cir.1994)). It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for leave to file ex parte a supplement to the motion to expedite be denied. The Clerk is directed to return the supplement to appellant. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to expedite and the motion for leave to file a document under seal be dismissed as moot.
 
Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.
