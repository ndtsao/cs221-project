*1 Dragon Intellectual Property appeals the district court’s Final Judgments entered pursuant to the parties’ stipulations of noninfringement of claims 1–4, 8, and 10 of U.S. Patent No. 5,930,444. Our decision today in a related case, Dragon Intellectual Property, LLC v. DISH Network LLC et al., Nos. 2016-2468, -2492, affirms the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s determination that claims 1–4, 7–10, 13, and 14 of the ’444 patent are invalid. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as moot.
