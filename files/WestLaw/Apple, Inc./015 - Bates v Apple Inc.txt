Opinion
*198 Affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

Marlow L. Bates, Sr., appeals the district court’s order dismissing his copyright infringement suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. See Bates v. Apple, Inc., No. 1:16-cv-00929-JFM (D. Md. Oct. 13, 2016). We deny Bates’ motion for the appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED
