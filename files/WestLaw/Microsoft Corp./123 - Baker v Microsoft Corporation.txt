ORDER
Per Curiam.
*1 Upon review of this recently docketed appeal, the court dismisses for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Richard J. Baker sued the defendants alleging infringement of his patent. Several of the defendants counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of invalidity. On January 3, 2017, the district court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. The district court, however, did not act on the defendants’ counterclaims. On May 2, 2017, the defendants moved for entry of final judgment dismissing all claims.
 
This court has jurisdiction of an appeal from a “final decision” of a district court in any civil action arising under the patent laws. 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1). A final decision is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945). In the absence of a decision of the district court ruling on the defendants’ invalidity counterclaims, we lack jurisdiction. See Pause Tech. LLC v. TiVo Inc., 401 F.3d 1290, 1293–94 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (dismissing as premature an appeal when the district court had not yet disposed of the counterclaims). We therefore dismiss the appeal, subject, however, to reinstatement under the same docket number without the payment of an additional filing fee if, within 30 days of this order, Mr. Baker appeals from the entry of a final judgment on the entire case or obtains a certificate for appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS ORDERED THAT:
 
(1) This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, subject, however, to reinstatement under the same docket number without the payment of an additional filing fee if, within 30 days of this order, Mr. Baker appeals from the entry of a final judgment on the entire case or obtains a certificate for appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b). The mandate shall issue simultaneously with this Order.
 
(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.
