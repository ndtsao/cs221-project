MEMORANDUM*
*1 1. The district court did not err in dismissing Reiser’s tying claim without leave to amend. A tying claim under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, requires the existence of two separate products. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U .S. 451, 462 (1992) (to defeat summary judgment motion in tying claim, plaintiff must show that two separate products were tied); Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 21 (1984) (“[A] tying arrangement cannot exist unless two separate product markets have been linked.”). Reiser does not allege that a separate market involving a “substantial volume of commerce,” Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 16, exists for either (1) Windows-compatible file systems, or (2) Windows operating systems without file systems. For purposes of this case, then, Windows is one product, not two.
 
Moreover, Reiser does not contend that Microsoft integrated its file system with Windows for arbitrary reasons, nor does he allege that there are no technical benefits to including a file system within an operating system. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935, 949-50 (D.C.Cir.1998). Reiser’s contention that separate markets could exist if we ordered Microsoft to disassemble its Windows operating system is beside the point. Antitrust law does not empower us to order the disaggregation of a single product into its component parts.
 
2. Reiser’s “essential facilities” claim fails because it requires the existence of a substantial market for Windows-compatible file systems, the product Reiser would seek to develop if he gained access to Microsoft’s source code. See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 545-46 (9th Cir.1991). Reiser has produced no evidence that such a market exists.
 
3. Nor did the district court err in dismissing for lack of standing Reiser’s claim that Microsoft improperly bundled its web browser with its operating system. Reiser does not produce a browser and, though he was given an opportunity to do so, failed to amend his complaint to show that he suffered an economic injury as a result of Microsoft’s alleged anti-competitive conduct. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 340 (1979) (consumer’s pecuniary loss establishes standing to bring action for alleged antitrust violations).
 
4. Reiser’s remaining contentions are equally without merit. His motions for sanctions for Microsoft’s deceptive litigation practices find no support in the record. To the extent that Reiser’s two submissions entitled “Notice of Disqualification Considerations” are motions to disqualify judges of this court from deciding his case, they are denied as groundless.
 
AFFIRMED.
