Before RADER and SCHALL, Circuit Judges, FRIEDMAN, Senior Circuit Judge.


ON MOTION
SCHALL, Circuit Judge.

ORDER
*1 Excite, Inc. moves to dismiss CIVIX-DDI, Inc.’s (CIVIX) appeal. CIVIX opposes.
 
CIVIX appealed the March 16, 2000 order of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado granting the defendants’ motions for summary judgment of noninfringement. On April 17, 2000, the district court, acting on Infoseek Corporation’s motion for clarification, clarified its March 16, 2000 order stating that “Infoseek’s counterclaims for relief based on unfair competition and tortious interference survive the March 16, 2000 judgment. These counterclaims were never addressed by dispositive motion. I hereby clarify the judgment to reflect that Infoseek’s counterclaims have not been dismissed and I retain jurisdiction over this action.” On April 25, 2000, several defendants filed a motion in district court seeking another clarification of the March 16, 2000 order. In that motion, the defendants stated that their declaratory judgment counterclaims on the issue of invalidity had not been adjudicated on the merits. That motion remains pending.
 
In its motion to dismiss, Excite argues that the March 16, 2000 order is not final and appealable because Excite’s counterclaim remains pending in the district court. CIVIX responds that the district court clearly intended to certify its March 16, 2000 order for appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and that this court should treat the order as if the district court did so.*
 
A final decision is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945). Here, it appears that several counterclaims remain undecided. Further, the district court did not certify its judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b). Therefore, the district court’s March 16, 2000 order was not final or appealable.
 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS ORDERED THAT:
 
(1) Excite’s motion to dismiss is granted.
 
(2) All parties shall bear their own costs.
