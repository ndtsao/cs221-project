1998 WL 543920
United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.
UNITED STATES of America, Appellee
v.
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Appellant.
No. 98-5399.
|
Aug. 19, 1998.
BEFORE: WILLIAMS, GINSBURG, and SENTELLE, Circuit Judges.


ORDER
*1 Upon consideration of the motion for a stay pending appeal, the oppositions and the lodged response thereto, and the reply; the motion for leave to file a response; and the supplemental authority submitted pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 28(j), it is
 
ORDERED that the motion for leave to file a response be granted. The Clerk is directed to file the lodged response. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for a stay of the district court’s August 11, 1998 order permitting members of the public to attend pretrial depositions be granted. See Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm’n. v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841 (D.C.Cir.1977); D.C. Circuit Handbook of Practice and Internal Procedures 60-62 (1997). The balance of harms favors appellant; if appellant prevails, the disclosure could not be undisclosed, whereas if appellees prevail, the text and videotape of a private deposition can then be disclosed. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED, on the court’s own motion, that the district court’s order, filed August 11, 1998, be vacated inasmuch as it stays depositions pending the development of a protocol for affording public access to pretrial depositions. This court’s order in no way governs the taking of those depositions, which may proceed in the manner they have to date. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED, on the court’s own motion, that this appeal be expedited and that the following briefing schedule shall apply:
Brief for Microsoft Corporation and Joint Appendix September 1, 1998
 
Brief for United States of America September 22, 1998
 
Joint Brief for Appellee States September 22, 1998

Reply Brief for Microsoft Corporation September 29, 1998
 
In addition to the merits, all parties are directed to address the basis for this court’s jurisdiction. Due to the expedited nature of this case, the court will not entertain dispositive motions. To avoid any duplication, appellees are obliged to consult during the preparation of their briefs and to adopt relevant portions of each other’s briefs. Briefs that are repetitious in whole or in part will not be accepted. All submissions are to be filed and delivered by hand. All briefs should be in final form.
 
The Clerk is directed to calendar this case for oral argument on the first appropriate date before this panel.
