JUDGMENT
*1 Pro se appellant Jeremy Southgate appeals from the decision of the district court dismissing his various trademark claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). After our own careful review of the record and the submissions of the parties, we affirm the dismissal, for substantially the reasons set forth by the district court in its March 31, 2016 Memorandum and Order.
 
We further find no error or abuse of discretion in the district court’s order striking pleadings which appellant filed without prior leave of court as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), or in the court’s order striking, without prejudice, appellant’s premature motion for summary judgment, which was filed before any defendant had had an opportunity to respond to the complaint. Having carefully considered each, we conclude that appellant’s other claims of error and his requests for mandamus and various other forms of relief are unconvincing. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
