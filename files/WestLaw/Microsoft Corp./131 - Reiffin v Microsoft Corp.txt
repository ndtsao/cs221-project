v.
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, William H. Gates, III, and Steven A. Ballmer, Defendants–Appellees.
No. 2012–1140.
|
June 11, 2012.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in case no. 11–CV–3505, Judge Charles R. Breyer.
ON MOTION


ORDER
*1 Microsoft Corporation moves to dismiss the current appeal as premature. Martin Gardner Reiffin opposes. Microsoft replies. Reiffin moves for leave to file a surreply.
 
Subsequently, on April 16, 2012, the district court entered final judgment in the underlying action. Reiffin filed another appeal, 2012–1357, and within that notice of appeal states that he withdraws this appeal, 2012–1140. We treat that statement as a withdrawal of his opposition to the motion to dismiss 2012–1140.
 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS ORDERED THAT:
 
The motions are granted. Appeal 2012–1140 is dismissed.
