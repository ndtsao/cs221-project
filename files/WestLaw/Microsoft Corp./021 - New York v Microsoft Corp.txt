ORDER
PER CURIAM.
In view of the exceptional importance of these cases and the fact that the number of judges of this court disqualified from participation as a practical possibility precludes any en banc rehearing of a panel decision, it is
 
ORDERED, sua sponte, by the en banc court that these cases and all motions and petitions filed in these cases be heard by the court sitting en banc. Parties shall hereafter file an original and nineteen copies of all pleadings and briefs submitted.
