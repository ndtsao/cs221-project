Opinion
PER CURIAM:

*1 Appellant Microsoft Corporation appeals the order of the district court remanding this suit to the state court. After Microsoft removed the suit from state court in Mississippi, the Appellee Attorney General moved to remand on three grounds: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c); (2) discretionary remand of matters in which state law predominates under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(c); and (3) lack of supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).
 
The district court granted Appellee’s motion, and in its reasoned opinion made clear that the basis of its order was the lack of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, the sole basis of Microsoft’s removal. Section 1447(d) states that “[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,” subject to an exception not relevant here. That section precludes our review of “decisions to remand when based on a perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction, even if the district court erroneously believes it lacks jurisdiction.” Charter School of Pine Grove, Inc. v. St. Helena Parish School Bd., 417 F.3d 444, 446 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting In re Bissonnet Invs. L.L.C., 320 F.3d 520, 524 (5th Cir.2003)). Because the remand order in this case is based on the district court’s judgment that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we have no jurisdiction to review the order.
 
Appeal DISMISSED.
