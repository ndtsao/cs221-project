United States Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit.
TYPERIGHT KEYBOARD CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant-Appellee.
No. 00-1477.
|
Dec. 4, 2000.
Before NEWMAN and LOURIE, Circuit Judges, FRIEDMAN, Senior Circuit Judge.


ON MOTION
LOURIE, Circuit Judge.

ORDER
*1 Microsoft Corporation moves to dismiss TypeRight Keyboard Corporation’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. TypeRight opposes. Microsoft replies.
 
TypeRight sued Microsoft for patent infringement. Microsoft counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct. On June 19, 2000, the district court orally granted Microsoft’s motion or summary judgment of invalidity. In a written order dated June 21, 2000, the district court denied Microsoft’s motion for summary judgment of unenforceabilty, and issued an order directing the entry of judgment on its oral ruling. Judgment was entered on June 22, 2000.
 
On July 6, 2000, Microsoft moved for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), arguing that judgment was entered in error because its counterclaims for declaratory relief remained pending. On July 13, 2000, TypeRight filed the instant appeal. On July 25, 2000, the district court granted Microsoft’s motion for relief from judgment and vacated its June 22, 2000 judgment, ruling that final judgment could not be entered because Microsoft’s counterclaim for inequitable conduct remained pending.
 
Microsoft now moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the judgment TypeRight designated in its notice of appeal was vacated. TypeRight opposes dismissal, asserting that final judgment properly was entered on June 22, 2000, and that its filing of the instant appeal divested the district court of authority to grant Microsoft’s Rule 60(b) motion and to vacate the judgment.
 
We disagree with TypeRight that the district court was without authority to vacate its June 22, 2000 judgment. Because Microsoft filed the Rule 60(b) motion within 10 days of judgment, the time for filing a notice of appeal was tolled. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i), Typeright’s notice of appeal, filed after judgment was entered but before the district court ruled on the Rule 60(b) motion, did not become effective until the order disposing of the Rule 60(b) motion was entered on July 25, 2000. Because the district court’s July 25, 2000 order granted Microsoft’s Rule 60(b) motion and vacated its June 22, 2000 judgment, there is no final decision for this court to review. See 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a).
 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS ORDERED THAT:
 
(1) Microsoft’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is granted.
 
(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.
