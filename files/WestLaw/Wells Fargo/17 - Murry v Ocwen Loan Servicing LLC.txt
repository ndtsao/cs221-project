ORDER
*1 This matter comes on for consideration of the parties’ responses to this court’s order of May 2, 2017. Upon consideration thereof, this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
Judgment was entered on February 21, 2017. Pursuant to the plaintiff’s timely motion for extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal, the district court granted the plaintiff until April 28, 2017 to file his appeal. However, he did not file the notice of appeal until May 1, 2017.
 
The plaintiff argues that the date of mailing should determine the filing date of the notice of appeal, and that it is unconstitutional for the court to use the date the notice of appeal was received in the district clerk’s office as the date of filing. This contention is without merit.
 
The Federal Rules of Appellant Procedure provide sufficient notice that filing means receipt by the district court clerk, and not the mailing date. The Rules clearly state that the notice must be received by the district clerk within the time prescribed. Rule 3(a)(1) states “An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.” Rule 4(a)(1)(A) provides that “the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed with the district court clerk ....” And Rule 25(a)(2)(A) provides that “Filing may be accomplished by mail addressed to the clerk, but filing is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.” See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(2)(A) (a filing is made by delivering the pleading to the clerk).
 
The plaintiff’s contention that because he is pro se he is discriminated against because he cannot electronically file documents is also without merit. Pro se parties are allowed to file electronically with permission from the court. See CM/ECF Manual Section II(A)(2). The court’s rules only state that counsel must file electronically. See 10th Cir. R. 25.3. Moreover, the plaintiff never moved to file electronically.
 
A timely notice of appeal in a civil case is both mandatory and jurisdictional. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209, 213 (2007). Because the notice of appeal was filed beyond the time allowed by the district court, this court lacks jurisdiction.
 
APPEAL DISMISSED.
