PER CURIAM:

Horace T. Harris appeals the district court’s order dismissing his complaint based on res judicata. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. Harris v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 3:16-cv-00174-JAG, 2017 WL 838687 (E.D. Va. Mar. 3, 2017). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED
