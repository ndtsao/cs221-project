MEMORANDUM*
*1 Nineteen current and former employees of Anheuser-Busch, Inc., appeal the dismissal of their state claims against Anheuser-Busch and other defendants. Defendants had conducted a search for drugs in the employees’ vehicles and on their persons in August 1995. The district court dismissed Appellants’ claims, holding that they were preempted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (“LMRA”), 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.
 
The only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred by dismissing Plaintiffs’ complaint as preempted by § 301 of the LMRA. We review de novo the district court’s decision regarding preemption. See Gee v. Southwest Airlines, 110 F.3d 1400, 1404 (9th Cir .), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 915, 118 S.Ct. 301, 139 L.Ed.2d 232 (1997).
 
Section 301 of the LMRA completely preempts any state law claim that is based on rights in a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) or is “ ‘substantially dependent on analysis of a collective-bargaining agreement.” ’ Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 394, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987) (quoting Electrical Workers v.. Hechler, 481 U.S. 851, 859 n. 3, 107 S.Ct. 2161, 95 L.Ed.2d 791 (1987)) (holding that claims of breach of a contract completely independent from the CBA are not preempted).
 
Section 301 preempts state privacy claims resulting from an employer search of a union worker because the claims are “inextricably intertwined” with the CBA between the employer and the employee’s union and would therefore substantially depend on an analysis of the CBA. See Stikes v. Chevron USA, Inc., 914 F.2d 1265, 1269 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that determining the reasonableness of an employee’s expectation of privacy is dependent on an analysis of the CBA). Similarly, § 301 preempts other state law claims that are dependent on and “peripheral to the privacy claim,” because their determination would necessarily involve an examination of the CBA. Id. at 1270.
 
This case falls squarely within Stikes. The determination of Plaintiffs’ reasonable expectation of privacy and of the privacy claims cannot be made without an examination of their applicable CBAs. Their privacy claims were, therefore, properly dismissed as preempted by § 301.
 
Plaintiffs’ other claims are either dependent on or peripheral to the privacy claims, or were otherwise dependent on an examination of the CBAs, and were properly dismissed.
 
AFFIRMED.
