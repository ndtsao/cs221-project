Decided: March 17, 1988.
C.D.Cal.
 
AFFIRMED.
 
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Central District of California; Edward Rafeedie, District Judge, Presiding.
Before BRUNETTI, KOZINSKI and DAVID R. THOMPSON, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM**
*1 Lyle Prenzler appeals pro se the district court’s order denying his petition for removal and remanding his California criminal prosecution to state court.
 
We first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court’s remand order. In general, removal orders are not reviewable “by appeal or otherwise.” 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) (1982). However, an exception exists where removal is based upon 28 U.S.C. § 1443(1) (1982). Prenzler’s removal petition relies, in part, on section 1443. See Petition for Removal, Clerk’s Record 1. Accordingly, we have authority to review the district court’s remand order.
 
A state criminal prosecution may be removed within 30 days of arraignment or at any time before trial, whichever is earlier. 28 U.S.C. § 1446(c)(1) (1982). After trial, however, a removal petition may be filed only if the district court, for good cause shown, grants leave to file a late petition. Id. Prenzler filed for removal only after he was tried and convicted. He failed to make any showing of good cause; indeed, he did not even allege good cause. The district court properly dismissed the petition as untimely.
 
AFFIRMED.
