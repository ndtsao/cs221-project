MEMORANDUM**
The district court properly entered summary judgment for the defendants and denied Gloria Romani’s motion for leave to amend her complaint as futile. Romani argues that the foreclosure sale of her property was invalid because the notice of sale that she received did not identify the proper beneficiary of the trust deed. However, the Oregon Trust Deed Act forbids post-sale challenges based on this technical defect in the notice of sale, for the reasons stated in Woods v. U.S. Bank N.A., 831 F.3d 1159, 2016 WL 4120687 (9th Cir. 2016). See Or. Rev. Stat. § 86.797(1) (formerly § 86.770(1)).
 
We need not consider whether Romani’s appeal is also barred by issue preclusion. For this reason, appellees’ motion for judicial notice is DENIED.
 
AFFIRMED.
