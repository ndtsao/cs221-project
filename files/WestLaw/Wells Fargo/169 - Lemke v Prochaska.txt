*1 Robert August Lemke appeals from the district court’s1 dismissal of his complaint. After careful review of the record and the parties’ briefs, we conclude that the judgment of the district court was correct, and that an extended opinion would have no precedential value. Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.
