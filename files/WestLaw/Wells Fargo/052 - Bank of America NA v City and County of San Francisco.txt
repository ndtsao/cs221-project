Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Vaughn R. Walker, District Judge, Presiding.
Before FARRIS, CANBY, and W. FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM1
*1 This preliminary injunction appeal comes to us for review under Ninth Circuit Rule 3-3. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), and we affirm.3
 
Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and the California Bankers Association brought this action challenging the validity of two recently-enacted municipal ordinances which forbid the assessment of fees to non-account holders using bank automated teller machines. The district court enjoined enforcement of the ordinances pending resolution of the lawsuit.
 
Our review of an order granting a preliminary injunction “is much more limited than review of an order involving a permanent injunction, where all conclusions of law are freely reviewable.” Walzac v. EPL Prolong, Inc., 198 F.3d 725, 730 (9th Cir.1999).
 
We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that preliminary injunctive relief was appropriate under the circumstances of this case. We therefore affirm the preliminary injunction. Our disposition of this appeal will affect the rights of the parties only until the district court renders final judgment. See Sports Form, Inc. v. United Press International, 686 F.2d 750, 752 (9th Cir.1982).
 
AFFIRMED.
