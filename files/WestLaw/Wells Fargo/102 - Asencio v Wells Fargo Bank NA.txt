Opinion
PER CURIAM:

The dismissal of the appellant’s complaint is affirmed for the reasons set forth in the ORDER of the district court dated November 21, 2012. We do not reach the issue of whether or not the district court erred in denying the appellant’s motion to file an amended complaint as there is no argument regarding this in the appellant’s main brief. See United States v. Magluta, 418 F.3d 1166, 1185 (11th Cir.2005) (ruling that a party abandons an argument if the party fails to raise the argument in the party’s initial brief).
 
AFFIRMED.
