Opinion
PER CURIAM:

In his amended complaint, Randall White alleged that in January 2005, he gave Green Point Mortgage Funding, Inc., a note in the principal amount of $232,000 secured by a mortgage on real property in Jupiter, Florida; that Green Point appraised the property at $290,000; and that the Palm Beach County Appraisal Report *381 indicated that the actual value of the property was $138,000. The amended complaint contains three claims against Green Point. Two are relevant here as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). More specifically, Counts II and III allege that Green Point is liable for the inflated property appraisal under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)-(d).
 
Green Point moved the District Court to dismiss White’s amended complaint on the ground that the RICO claims were barred by the four-year statute of limitations. Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley–Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 156, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 2767, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987) (“[W]e conclude that ... the federal policies that lie behind RICO and the practicalities of RICO litigation make the selection of the 4–year statute of limitations for Clayton Act actions, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, the most appropriate limitations period for RICO actions.”). The District Court, in an order entered on June 26, 2014, agreed that the claims were time-barred and dismissed White’s claims with prejudice.
 
White appeals. We affirm. We note that White did not oppose Green Point’s motion to dismiss. As a general rule, a party presented with a motion to dismiss “must proffer some legal basis to support his cause of action.” Cnty. of McHenry v. Ins. Co. of the West, 438 F.3d 813, 818 (7th Cir.2006). And “[a]rguments raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before this Court.” Hurley v. Moore, 233 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). The arguments White presents in support of the timeliness of his claims were not presented to the District Court. We therefore do not consider them.
 
AFFIRMED.
