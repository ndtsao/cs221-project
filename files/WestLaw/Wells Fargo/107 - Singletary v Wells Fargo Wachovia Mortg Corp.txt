Opinion
Dismissed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

**1 John G. Singletary, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court’s entry of a scheduling order in his civil suit against Wells Fargo Wachovia Mortgage Corporation. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545–46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Singletary seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, as no judge has requested a poll on Singletary’s motion for en banc reconsideration of the denial of his motion for stay, we deny that motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
DISMISSED.
