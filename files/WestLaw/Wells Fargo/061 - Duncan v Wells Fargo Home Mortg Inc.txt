Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, James C. Mahan, District Judge, Presiding. D.C. No. 2:11–cv–00864–JCM–PAL.
Before: CANBY, TROTT, and W. FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM**
*1 Dawn J. Duncan appeals pro se from the district court’s judgment dismissing her diversity action arising from foreclosure proceedings. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo, Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2005), and we affirm.
 
The district court properly dismissed Duncan’s action because Duncan failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the notice and guide regarding a short sale option constituted an enforceable contract. See May v. Anderson, 121 Nev. 668, 119 P.3d 1254, 1257 (2005) (“Basic contract principles require, for an enforceable contract, an offer and acceptance, meeting of the minds, and consideration.”).
 
AFFIRMED.
