Before PREGERSON, FERNANDEZ, and WARDLAW, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM1
*1 Arizona state prisoner Charles Fordjour appeals pro se the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel’s (“BAP”) dismissal of his appeal from the bankruptcy court’s dismissal of his chapter 13 action. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(d). We review the BAP’s legal conclusions de novo and factual determinations for clear error. See McClellan Fed. Credit Union v. Parker (In re Parker), 139 F .3d 668, 670 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.
 
The BAP properly dismissed Fordjour’s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Fordjour’s notice of appeal was not timely filed. See Preblich v. Battley, 181 F.3d 1048, 1056 & n. 6 (9th Cir.1999).
 
AFFIRMED.
