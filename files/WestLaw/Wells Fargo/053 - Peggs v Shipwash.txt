Opinion
Affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

James Ronald Peggs appeals the district court’s order dismissing his civil complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a subsequent order denying reconsideration. *110 We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. Peggs v. Shipwash, No. 3:15–cv–00278–RJC, 2016 WL 830865 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 3, 2016; Mar. 30, 2016). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED
