PER CURIAM.
In this action arising out of the foreclosure sale of her home, Nicole Zellner appeals the district court’s1 grant of defendants’ motions for judgment on the pleadings. Following careful de novo review of the pleadings and public records attached thereto, see Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.1999), we affirm for the reasons articulated in defendants’ unopposed motions and relied on by the district court. See 8th Cir. R. 47B. Zellner’s motion to supplement the record is denied.
