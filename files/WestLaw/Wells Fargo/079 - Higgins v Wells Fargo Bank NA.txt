Opinion
Richard L. Nygaard Circuit Judge

*1 Submitted by the clerk for possible dismissal due to a jurisdictional defect in the above-captioned case.
 

ORDER
The foregoing appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the order appealed from is neither final nor appealable at this time. Generally, this Court may hear appeals only from final orders of the District Court. See 28 U.S.C. § 1291; Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 373 (1981). A dismissal without prejudice is neither final nor appealable unless “the plaintiff cannot amend or declares his intention to stand on his complaint.” Borelli v. City of Reading, 532 F.2d 950, 952 (3d Cir. 1976) (per curiam). The District Court here dismissed Higgins’ § 1983 claim without prejudice, and he has not taken any action that indicates he intends to stand on his complaint. See id. The litigation in the District Court is not over; Higgins may still seek to amend his complaint.
