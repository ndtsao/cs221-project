Opinion
*234 Dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

Kobi J. Mullins appeals the district court’s order dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. Mullins v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 3:16-cv-00841-REP, 2017 WL 1202656 (E.D. Va. Mar. 30, 2017). We also deny Mullins’ motion to add a party. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
DISMISSED
