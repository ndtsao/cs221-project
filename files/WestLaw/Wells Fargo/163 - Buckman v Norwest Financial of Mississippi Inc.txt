James William Craig, Phelps Dunbar, Jackson, MS, for Defendant-Appellant.
*708 Appeal from the United States District Court, For the Southern District of Mississippi, Jackson Division, (99-CV-181-BR).
Before REAVLEY, JONES, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges.
Opinion
PER CURIAM:*

**1 Defendants-Appellants bring this appeal of a district court’s order remanding this case to the state court from which it was removed. Alternatively, Defendants-Appellants petition this court for a writ of mandamus to correct what they contend is an erroneous remand order. “An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.” See 28 U.S.C. 1447(d); In re Excel Corp., 106 F.3d 1197 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, because the district court’s remand order was based on a defect in the removal procedure, i.e., the untimeliness of removal, we lack jurisdiction to hear Defendants-Appellants’ appeal or to grant the mandamus petition. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction and the petition for mandamus is denied.
