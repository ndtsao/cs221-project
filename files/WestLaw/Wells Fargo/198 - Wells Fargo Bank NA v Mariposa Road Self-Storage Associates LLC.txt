MEMORANDUM**
Wells Fargo Bank, NA, appeals the district court’s order dismissing as moot its appeal of the bankruptcy court’s order confirming the appellees’ joint plan of reorganization. We review de novo, Rosemere Neighborhood Ass’n v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 581 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir.2009), and we reverse and remand.
 
Wells Fargo suggests that relief is available, should its objections to confirmation be sustained, because the debtors could be directed to pay it additional money under the plan either as it currently reads, or through some modification. We agree that the possibility of resolution by money damages is sufficient to present a live controversy. See In re Thorpe Insulation Co., 677 F.3d 869, 883 (9th Cir.2012); In re Spirtos, 992 F.2d 1004, 1006 (9th Cir.1993).
 
Accordingly, the order of the district court, dated September 27, 2012, is reversed, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings.
 
REVERSED and REMANDED.
