Opinion
BY THE COURT:

*1 Now before the Court is Appellants’ November 1, 2012, response (the “Response”) to our October 26, 2012, Order (the “Omnibus Order”), in which we dismissed certain of these appeals in part as untimely and directed Appellants to show cause why we should not summarily affirm the district court to the extent the appeals were timely filed.1 We also construe the Response as a notice that Appellants believe that grounds exist for the members of this panel to disqualify themselves from these appeals.2
 

I. INTRODUCTION
In the Omnibus Order, we explained in detail why, to the extent the Court was not or had not already dismissed the appeals,3 the judgments of the district court might be due to be summarily affirmed. We also explained why we were considering declaring Appellants to be vexatious litigants and subjecting them to conditions and restrictions on any future appeals in this Court. We provided Appellants with thirty days to show cause in response to the Omnibus Order, and we allowed them to file a consolidated response of up to sixty pages in length, to ensure that Appellants would have ample time and space to present their arguments to the Court.
 
Five days after issuance of the Omnibus Order, Appellants filed the Response. The Response does not address the issues we identified as potentially dispositive. Accordingly, in Part II of this Order we summarily dispose of all remaining issues in these appeals.
 
The Response also fails to provide any reason why we should not declare Appellants to be vexatious litigants and impose appropriate conditions and restrictions on future appeals. Accordingly, in Part III of this Order we take actions that will both protect the Court’s jurisdiction from any future vexatious and abusive litigation Appellants may pursue and protect Appellants’ right to access the courts.
 
We conclude in Part IV of this Order.
 

II. DISPOSTITION OF APPEALS4

A. Aurora (Appeal No. 12–11824)
In the Omnibus Order, we dismissed Aurora in part as untimely, to the extent Appellants appealed the July 5, 2011, judgment and any orders entered in 2011. We allowed the appeal to proceed as to the March 9, 2012, order denying Appellants’ motion for entry of judgment. However, after reviewing the Response, Appellants’ May 11, 2012, brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we conclude that the district court was clearly correct in denying Appellants’ motion for entry of judgment on the grounds that there was no operative pleading under which the court could grant relief. The March 9, 2012, order is hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

B. Wachovia (Appeal No. 12–11825)
As set out in the Omnibus Order, Wachovia remains closed, with no further filings to be tendered or accepted.
 

C. Scriven (Appeal No. 12–12599)
In the Omnibus Order, we dismissed Scriven in part as untimely, to the extent Appellants appealed the March 9, 2011, judgment and the March 16, 2011, denial of Appellants’ construed Fed .R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. We allowed the appeal to proceed as to the April 12, 2011, order and subsequent orders.
 
*2 As explained in the Omnibus Order, Appellants are correct in arguing that the district court erred procedurally in relying on 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(iii) to dismiss a fee-paid complaint. “... [B]ecause § 1915, which governs only IFP proceedings, does not apply to Farese’s fees-paid RICO claim, the district court was not authorized to dismiss the RICO claim pursuant to § 1915.” Farese v. Scherer, 342 F.3d 1223, 1228–1229 (11th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, despite such error, we may affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record. See, e.g., American United Life Ins. v. Martinez, 480 F.3d 1043, 1059 (11th Cir.2007).
 
We found in the Omnibus Order that Appellants’ complaint in Scriven was patently frivolous on its face, and we explained that a district court has the inherent authority to dismiss a patently frivolous complaint. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. First East Seventh Street Tenants Corp., 221 F.3d 362, 364 (2d Cir.2000) (district courts may dismiss a frivolous complaint sua sponte even when the plaintiff has paid the required filing fee, just as courts of appeals may dismiss frivolous matters in like circumstances, citing Mallard v. United States District Court. 490 U.S. 296, 109 S.Ct. 1814 (1989)); cf. Jefferson Fourteenth Associates v. Wometco de Puerto Rico, Inc., 695 F.2d 524, 526 (11 th Cir.1983) (district court lacks authority to dismiss complaint sua sponte on the merits without notice, but expressly declining to hold that district court may not dismiss complaints that “are so patently lacking in merit as to be frivolous”; noting that other circuits had upheld sua sponte dismissal of patently frivolous or vexatious lawsuits).
 
Because the district court would have had inherent authority to dismiss Appellants’ patently frivolous complaint, the court’s error in dismissing pursuant to § 1915(e)(2) constituted harmless error. Therefore, after reviewing the Response, Appellants’ June 25, 2012, brief, and pertinent portions of the record, the April 12, 2011, order and subsequent orders are hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

D. Moran (Appeal No, 12–13442)
After reviewing the Response, Appellants’ August 6, 2012, brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we find no error in the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing. The judgment of the district court is hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

Fuller I (Appeal No. 12–11826)
After reviewing the Response, Appellants’ May 11, 2012, brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we find that Appellants have made no colorable challenge to the only order properly before the Court in Fuller I, i.e., the denial as moot of Appellants’ motion for entry of judgment. The March 20, 2012, order of the district court is hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

E. Presnell (Appeal No. 12–11827)
As we explained in the Omnibus Order, Presnell is plainly frivolous to the extent that Appellants challenge the district court’s dismissal of the complaint, but not to the extent Appellants challenge the pre-screening filing injunction, as modified (the “Modified Screening Injunction”). Even so, as we also explained, an appellant waives any argument not presented in his initial brief. We ordered Appellants to show cause why the Modified Screening Injunction should not be summarily affirmed for failure to present any meaningful challenge to the injunction in their May 11, 2012, brief. In doing so, we explicitly gave Appellants the opportunity to highlight for the Court those arguments in their brief that, in Appellants’ view, articulated any arguments concerning entry or modification of the Modified Screening Injunction or the terms thereof. After reviewing the Response, Appellants’ May 11, 2012, brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we again find that Appellants have made no colorable challenge to the Modified Screening Injunction. Because Appellants have waived any potential non-frivolous arguments they might have made, the Modified Screening Injunction is hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.5
 

F. Merryday (Appeal No. 12–12437)
*3 After reviewing the Response, Mr. Cuyler’s brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we find that Mr. Cuyler has made no colorable challenge to the only order properly before the Court, i .e., the denial as moot of Appellants’ motion for entry of judgment. The judgment of the district court is hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

G. Middle District (Appeal No. 12–11828)
After reviewing the Response, Mr. Cuyler’s brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we find that the orders and judgment in Middle District were clearly correct and are hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

H. Fuller II (Appeal No. 12–11829)
After reviewing the Response, Mr. Cuyler’s brief, and pertinent portions of the record, we find that the orders and judgment in Fuller II were clearly correct and are hereby SUMMARILY AFFIRMED.
 

III. FRIVOLITY SCREENING IN FUTURE CASES
We have reviewed the Response and find nothing therein to alter our conclusion that Appellants have engaged in abusive and vexatious litigation in district court and this Court by repeatedly filing frivolous lawsuits and appeals. To protect the Court’s jurisdiction from such vexatious and abusive practices, while at the same time preserving Appellants’ ability to pursue non-frivolous appeals and petitions without counsel, we hereby ORDER that the following actions be taken:
(i) Should Appellants, or either of them, file any new pro se notice of appeal, pro se petition for review, or pro se petition for extraordinary writ, such appeal or petition shall be automatically stayed immediately upon docketing until the Court has determined whether it appears to be facially frivolous. If so, the Court will issue an order directing Appellant(s) to show cause within fourteen (14) days why the appeal or petition should not be dismissed as frivolous sua sponte. If the appeal or petition does not appear to be facially frivolous, the Court will give Appellant(s) permission to proceed.
(ii) The response filed by Appellants, or either of them, to any order to show cause issued pursuant to subparagraph (i) will be submitted to the Court for a determination whether the appeal or petition should be dismissed as frivolous sua sponte or should instead be
(iii) Until and unless the Court determines that any such appeal or petition may proceed, the appeal shall remain stayed, and the Clerk shall not accept any filings therein other than a timely response to the order to show cause.
(iv) If Appellants fails to respond to an order to show cause within the fourteen days allotted, the appeal or petition shall be dismissed for want of prosecution.
The above procedure shall apply to any pro se appeal or petition by Appellants, or either of them, that is docketed after the date of entry of this order. In addition, the Court retains the discretion to dismiss an appeal if it appears at any time that the appeal is frivolous and entirely without merit, see 11th Cir. R. 42–4, and/or to impose sanctions for a frivolous appeal, see Fed.R.App.P. 38, and/or to impose sanctions for filing a frivolous motion, see 11th Cir. R. 27–4.
 

IV. CONCLUSION
*4 Appellants may file one motion for reconsideration of this Order within twenty-one (21) of the date of its entry, with no extensions to be granted. With that exception, Appellants are ENJOINED from filing any further motions or other papers in these appeals, which are closed, and the Clerk is DIRECTED to accept no further filings other than a single timely motion for reconsideration.

When necessary to refer to individual appeals, we will use the name of the first-listed Defendant–Appellee when necessary to refer to individual appeals, as follows: 12–11824 (“Aurora ”); 12–11825 (“Wachovia ”); 12–11826 (“Fuller I ”); 12–11827 (“Presnell ”); 12–11828 (“Middle District ”); 12–11829 (“Fuller II ”); 12–12437 (“Merryday ”); 12–12599 (“Scriven ”); and 12–13442 (“Moran ”). As detailed in the Omnibus Order, Wachovia is closed, having been dismissed in part as untimely and dismissed in part as frivolous. The remaining appeals are still open, although Aurora, Scriven, and Fuller I have all been dismissed in part as untimely. With the exception of Merrvdav. these appeals arise from civil actions filed by Mark Cuyler, sometimes joined by Teresa A. Mitchell. Mr. Cuyler is an Appellant in all of these appeals. Ms. Mitchell (also known as Teresa A. Mitchell Cuyler) is an Appellant in Aurora, Fuller I, Presnell, and Scriven.

See Omnibus Order, pp. 18–19. The members of this panel find that no grounds exist for their recusal or disqualification under either 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) or 28 U.S.C. § 455(b). In particular, and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, we conclude that no objective, disinterested lay observer, fully informed of the facts underlying Appellants’ allegations would entertain any significant doubt about the impartiality of the members of this panel, as required for disqualification under 28 U.S .C. § 455(a). See e.g., United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 828–829 (11th Cir.2007) (collecting cases). “It has long been established ... that a party cannot force a judge to recuse himself by engaging in personal attacks on the judge [.]” Standing Commit tee on Discipline of U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of California v. Yagman, 55 F.3d 1430, 1443–1444 (9th Cir.1995). Moreover, a litigant’s actual or threatened lawsuit against a judge is not grounds for disqualification. See In re Bush. 232 Fed.Appx. 852, 853–854, 2007 WL 283080, 2 (11th Cir.2007) (unpubl .). “A judge is not disqualified by a litigant’s suit or threatened suit against him ..., or by a litigant’s intemperate and scurrilous attacks [.]” United States v. Studley, 783 F.2d 934, 940 (9th Cir.1986) (citations omitted); see also Azubuko v. Royal, 443 F.3d 302, 304 (3nd Cir.2006); United States v. Grismore, 564 F.2d 929, 933 (10th Cir.1977).

3

We specifically enjoined Appellants from filing any motion for reconsideration, clarification, or modification of the Omnibus Order. See Omnibus Order, p. 18. We therefore do not construe the Response as seeking any such relief.

4

As we did in the Omnibus Order, we discuss the appeals in the chronological order of the underlying district court actions, rather than the respective filing dates for each appeal.

5

We express no opinion on any potential arguments concerning the Modified Screening Injunction that could have been but were not presented to us in Presnell.
