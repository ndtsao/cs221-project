ORDER
*1 Candace E. Alston seeks to appeal the district court’s orders granting summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and denying her motion to alter or amend the judgment. Wells Fargo has moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely.
 
Parties are accorded 30 days after the entry of the district court’s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). “[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).
 
The district court’s final order was entered on the docket on August 23, 2016. The notice of appeal was filed on September 26, 2016. Because Alston failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the motion to dismiss the appeal.
 
Entered at the direction of the panel: Judge Floyd, Judge Harris, and Senior Judge Davis.
