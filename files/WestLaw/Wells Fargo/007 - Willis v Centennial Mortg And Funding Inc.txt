[UNPUBLISHED]
PER CURIAM.
**1 Berry Allen Willis appeals the district court’s1 judgment, in part dismissing for failure to state a claim and in part granting summary judgment against him, in his action under federal civil rights provisions and state law. Having conducted de novo review of the record, see S.J. v. Kansas City Mo. Pub. Sch. Dist., 294 F.3d 1025, 1027 (8th Cir.2002) (summary judgment); Atkinson v. Bohn, 91 F.3d 1127, 1128 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (dismissal for failure to state claim), we find the district court’s analysis to be thorough and well reasoned, and we reject Willis’s baseless arguments for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Willis’s pending motion.
