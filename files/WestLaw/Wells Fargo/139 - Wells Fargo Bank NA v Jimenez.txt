ORDER
*1 Defendant Pilar Jimenez seeks to appeal the district court’s August 6, 2008 Final Order reversing the bankruptcy court and remanding for entry of an order granting Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank’s motion for summary judgment. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The notice of appeal was not timely filed.
 
Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), a party has thirty days after entry of a district court’s final judgment or order to file a timely notice of appeal. In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366 (2007), the Court made clear that “the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.”
 
In this case, the district court’s final order was entered on the docket on August 6, 2008. The thirty-day deadline for filing a timely appeal expired on September 5, 2008. Defendant’s notice of appeal was filed on September 8, 2008, which was three days past the deadline. Defendant did not move in the district court for an extension of time under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). The notice of appeal is untimely.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
