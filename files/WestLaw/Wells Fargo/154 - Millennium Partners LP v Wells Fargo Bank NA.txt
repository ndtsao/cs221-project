Plaintiffs–Appellants Millennium Partners, L.P. and Millennium Fixed Income, Ltd.

Apr. 17, 2013), and Judge Koetl in his similarly thorough and well-reasoned denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, Millennium Partners, L.P. v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, No. 12 Civ. 7581, 2015 WL 6454844 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2015).
 
We have considered all of the Plaintiffs’ arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.
