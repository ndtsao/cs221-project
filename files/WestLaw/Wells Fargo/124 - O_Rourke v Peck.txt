Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California Barry T. Moskowitz, District Judge, Presiding.
Before CANBY, O’SCANNLAIN, and W. FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM1
*1 Albert O’Rourke appeals pro se the district court’s dismissal of his action alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962, and the district court’s imposition of a vexatious litigant order. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm.
 
We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Stone v. Travelers Corp., 58 F.3d 434, 436-37 (9th Cir.1995) (failure to state a claim); Allah v. Superior Court, 871 F.2d 887, 890 (9th Cir.1989) (subject matter jurisdiction). We review for abuse of discretion the imposition of a vexatious litigant order. See DeLong v. Hennessey, 912 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1990).
 
The district court properly dismissed the claims seeking review of state court judgments for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983). The district court properly dismissed the RICO claims for failure to state a claim. See Bowen v. Oistead, 125 F.3d 800, 806 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that civil rights violations do not fall within the definition of “racketeering activity”), cert. denied, 118 S.Ct. 2343 (1998); Oscar v. University Students Coop. Ass’n, 965 F .2d 783, 785 (9th Cir.1992) (en banc) (stating that personal injuries are not compensable under RICO). The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a vexatious litigant order. See DeLong, 912 F.2d at 1146-48.
 
Appellant’s June 4, 1998 “Motion to Strike, Redact, or Otherwise Amend Appellees’ Briefs and Filings” is denied. Appellant’s September 24, 1998 “Motion for an Injunction or Order Staying Defendant RICO Violating Actions” is denied. Appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s May 7, 1998 motion to strike appellant’s brief and dismiss the appeal is denied.
 
AFFIRMED.
