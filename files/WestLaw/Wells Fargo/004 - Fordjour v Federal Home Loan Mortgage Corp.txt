Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Roslyn O. Silver, District Judge, Presiding.
Before BEEZER, O’SCANNLAIN, and THOMAS, Circuit Judges.


MEMORANDUM1
*1 Charles Fordjour appeals pro se the district court’s judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissing his action for failure to state a claim. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo, see Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct. 1058 (1999), and affirm.
 
Fordjour’s contention that the district court erred by dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim lacks merit because Fordjour did not allege facts demonstrating that appellees acted under color of state law. See Schucker v. Rockwood, 846 F.2d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam); see also Harper v. Federal Land Bank of Spokane, 878 F.2d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.1989) (use of state’s foreclosure procedures not state action).
 
We reject Fordjour’s remaining contentions as lacking merit.
 
AFFIRMED.
