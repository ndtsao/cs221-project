JUDGMENT
*1 The plaintiffs have appealed from the district court’s June 20, 2016, order. The challenged order dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief, but left other claims for damages remaining. Defendants-appellees have moved to dismiss this appeal as interlocutory. Having reviewed the parties’ filings, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, and we grant the motion to dismiss.
 
Appellants contend that the district court’s order had the practical effect of refusing an injunction, and that appellate jurisdiction therefore exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Although the appellants do not cite Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79 (1981), their theory of jurisdiction rests on it. Under that theory,
[w]here an interlocutory order does not expressly deny injunctive relief, ... a party may only appeal if (1) the district court’s decision had the practical effect of denying injunctive relief; (2) the denial of injunctive relief would ‘cause serious (if not irreparable) harm’; and (3) the order can effectively be challenged only through an immediate appeal.
Nwaubani v. Grossman, 806 F.3d 677, 680 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N.Y., Inc. v. Colombani, 712 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Carson, 450 U.S. at 83–84)). See also Anderson v. City of Boston, 244 F.3d 236, 239–40 (1st Cir. 2001).
 
On this record and under our precedent, the appellants do not meet this test. We assume favorably to the appellants that the challenged order had the practical effect of refusing an injunction. However, the record shows that the plaintiffs did not at any point renew their request for preliminary injunctive relief after the case was removed to federal court, and the failure to press a request for preliminary injunctive relief points against a finding of serious harm. Cf. Anderson, 244 F.3d at 239. Likewise, a failure to seek other available avenues of interlocutory review—such as certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)—supports an inference that serious harm does not exist. See id.
 
Even if we assume the second Carson factor in the appellants’ favor, appellate review is unavailable under section 1292(a)(1) because the challenged interlocutory order here had the practical effect of denying permanent injunctive relief, not preliminary injunctive relief. In general, such an order can be adequately challenged on appeal from the final judgment. See Plymouth County Nuclear Info. Comm., Inc. v. Boston Edison Co., 655 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1981) (“There are sound policy reasons that militate against permitting, as of right, interlocutory appeals from orders which affect only a claim to permanent relief.”). To the extent that the appellants might argue that the district court’s order also had the effect of denying preliminary injunctive relief, this court has rejected that line of argument. See Anderson, 244 F.3d at 240 (denying “interlocutory review of the refusal of a permanent injunction despite the assumption that such refusal would ‘foreclose any meaningful future consideration’ of claims for injunctive relief”) (quoting Plymouth County Nuclear Info. Comm., Inc., 655 F.2d at 17).
 
*2 Under these circumstances, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Appeal dismissed.
