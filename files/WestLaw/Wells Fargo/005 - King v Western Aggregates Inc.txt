MEMORANDUM1
*1 Appellants Larry King, et al., appeal from the district court’s dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of their civil rights action against Western Aggregates. The district court held that the plaintiffs could not succeed in federal court unless they could successfully maintain a quiet title action under federal law. Although plaintiffs acknowledge they could not do this, their lawsuit is not a federal quiet title action. Instead, plaintiffs claim that their civil rights were violated by interference with their constitutional rights on public land.
 
While it appears to be true that plaintiffs cannot succeed on their action if the land in question was indisputably private, that issue could not properly be determined on a jurisdictional motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs invoke federal jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Even if ownership of the land could be considered a jurisdictional question, it is intertwined with the merits of the case and not suitable for resolution under FRCP 12(b)(1). See Roberts v. Carrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.1987). The merits of plaintiffs’ civil rights action, including issues with respect to the public or private ownership of the land, should be determined on summary judgment or at trial.
 
The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.
