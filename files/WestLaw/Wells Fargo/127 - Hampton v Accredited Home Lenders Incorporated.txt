PER CURIAM:

Frank E. Hampton appeals the district court’s order granting a motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, HSI Asset Securitization Corp., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (“Moving Defendants”) and dismissing all claims against Moving Defendants. “[W]e have an independent obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction” and may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. Porter v. Zook, 803 F.3d 694, 696 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292 (2012); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). “Ordinarily, a district court order is not final until it has resolved all claims as to all parties.” Porter, 803 F.3d at 696 (internal quotation marks omitted). “Regardless of the label given a district court decision, if it appears from the record that the district court has not adjudicated all of the issues in a case, then there is no final order.” Id.
 
In his complaint, Hampton alleged multiple causes of action against Moving Defendants, as well as Accredited Home Lenders, Inc. (“Accredited”); the record reflects that Accredited was served but never filed an answer or a motion to dismiss. The district court granted Moving *785 Defendants’ motion to dismiss but did not address any claims against Accredited. Thus, the court “never issued a final decision.” Id. at 699.
 
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand to the district court. We express no view on the ultimate disposition of Hampton’s claims against Accredited. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
DISMISSED AND REMANDED
