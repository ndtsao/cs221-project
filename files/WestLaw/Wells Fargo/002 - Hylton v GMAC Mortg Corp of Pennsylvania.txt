MEMORANDUM*
*1 Richard G.B. Hylton appeals pro se the district court’s Fed.R.Civ .P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of his action alleging that defendants violated California state law and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. § 2601, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692, when they foreclosed on Hylton’s residence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.
 
We review de novo, see Cohen v. Stratosphere Corp., 115 F.3d 695, 700 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court’s order filed on November 6, 1996.
 
AFFIRMED.
