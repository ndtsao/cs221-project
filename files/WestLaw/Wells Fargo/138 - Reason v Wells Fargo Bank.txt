MEMORANDUM1
*1 Evelyn J. Reason appeals from the district court’s dismissal of her action for failure to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. Although the district court dismissed the action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we must “raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte,” Solan v. Beilby, 761 F.2d 1369, 1370 (9 th Cir.1985), and must affirm a district court’s decision “if it can be supported on any ground, even one not relied upon by the district court,” Lopez v. Smith, No. 97-16987, 2000 WL 144385 at *2 (9 th Cir. Feb. 10, 2000) (en banc).
 
Reason claims that Wells Fargo deprived her of her rights to a jury trial and due process of law, as well as her right to be free of race discrimination in employment, and acted and conspired, allegedly in concert with the state trial court, to deprive her of these rights. A district court “does not have jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges to a state court’s decision.” Dubinka v. Judges of the Superior Court, 23 F.3d 218, 221 (9 th Cir.1994) (citing District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 482-86 (1983)). Reason’s claims are “inextricably intertwined” with the previous state court decisions in wrongful employment actions she brought against the defendants. Feldman, 460 U.S. at 48. Thus, we lack jurisdiction over the action under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See id.; Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923).
 
AFFIRMED.
