Opinion
Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
PER CURIAM:

James T. Luther appeals from the district court’s order granting in part the Defendants’ motion to dismiss, its order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granting summary judgment to the Defendants on the remaining claims, and its order denying reconsideration. Many of Luther’s claims on appeal were never properly presented to the district court; thus, we do not consider those claims. Muth v. United States, 1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).
 
As to the properly presented claims, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. Luther v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 4:13–cv–00072–MFU–RSB (W.D.Va. Nov. 17, 2014, Apr. 9, 2015, Apr. 21, 2015). We deny Luther’s motion to show cause. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED.
