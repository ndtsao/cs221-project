MEMORANDUM*
*1 Maurice McCrimmon, pro se, appeals the district court’s dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) of his employment discrimination claim brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. and under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal.Gov’t Code § 12900 et seq. against Wells Fargo Bank. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the decision below for the reasons stated by the district court in its order for judgment dismissing the action (CR 114).
 
McCrimmon failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. See Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). The record also fails to demonstrate that McCrimmon was forced to quit his job because of intolerable and discriminatory working conditions. Thorne v. City of El Segundo, 802 F.2d 1131, 1134 n. 1 (9th Cir.1986). McCrimmon’s remaining miscellaneous claims are without merit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
