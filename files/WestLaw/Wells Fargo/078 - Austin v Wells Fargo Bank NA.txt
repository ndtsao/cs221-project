Affirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.
Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.
*792 PER CURIAM:

Lisha Austin appeals the district court’s order dismissing her complaint with prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37. On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant’s brief. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Austin’s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court’s disposition, Austin has forfeited appellate review of the court’s order. See Williams v. Giant Food Inc., 370 F.3d 423, 430 n.4 (4th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.
 
AFFIRMED
