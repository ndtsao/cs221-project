ORDER
PER CURIAM.
*1 Upon consideration of this court’s order to show cause filed July 7, 2004, and appellants’ response thereto; the motion for a stay pending appeal and the response thereto; and the briefs filed by the parties, it is
 
ORDERED that the order to show cause be discharged. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal be dismissed. An action becomes moot if it becomes impossible for a court, at any stage in the proceedings, to remedy the complained-of injuries. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997). Under the Bankruptcy Code, in the absence of a stay, the sale of estate property to a good faith purchaser cannot be overturned on appeal. See In re Magwood, 785 F.2d 1077, 1080-81 (D.C.Cir.1986), citing 11 U.S.C. § 363(m). Thus, this court would be unable to fashion any remedy to address appellants’ asserted injury even if it were to find that the district court’s denial of the motion for a stay pending appeal was improper. See Magwood, 785 F.2d at 1080-81. As there is no “present, live controversy” for this court to decide, see Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969), the appeal must be dismissed as moot. It is
 
FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for a stay pending appeal be dismissed as moot.
 
Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.
