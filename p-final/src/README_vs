# Data Sanitation
1. After downloading the initial dataset ("/files/Wine/winemag-data-130k-.csv"), we ran "/src/data_cleanup.py" to derive "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv".

2. We then manually reviewed "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv" to sanitize the data further.

# Sentiment Analysis
3. We ran /src/sentiment_google.py (requires "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv") using authentication (not included in submission, as this is linked a personal account) to derive sentiment scores. This file is stored as "/src/wine-cleaned-google-final.csv".

4. To generate plots, we ran "/src/sentiment_plot.py" (requires "/src/wine-cleaned-google-final.csv"). That file has options ("OPTIONS") to be adjusted for different plots. Finally, we ran "/src/wine_analysis.R" to run linear and multinomial logistic (nnet) models. "/src/wine_analysis.R" also contains some code for error and general dataset analysis.
