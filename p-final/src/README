# Data Sanitation
1. After downloading the initial dataset ("/files/Wine/winemag-data-130k-.csv"), we ran "/src/data_cleanup.py" to derive "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv".

2. We then manually reviewed "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv" to sanitize the data further.

# Sentiment Analysis
3. We ran /src/sentiment_google.py (requires "/files/Wine/wine-clean.csv") using authentication (not included in submission, as this is linked a personal account) to derive sentiment scores. This file is stored as "/src/wine-cleaned-google-final.csv".

4. To generate plots, we ran "/src/sentiment_plot.py" (requires "/src/wine-cleaned-google-final.csv"). That file has options ("OPTIONS") to be adjusted for different plots. Finally, we ran "/src/wine_analysis.R" to run linear and multinomial logistic (nnet) models. "/src/wine_analysis.R" also contains some code for error and general dataset analysis.

Computing cross-validation errors for the TFIDF, Naive Bayes, and sentiment models:
1. Download the following files from https://github.com/ndtsao/cs221-project/tree/master/files/Wine:
  - reds.csv
  - whites.csv
  - wine_cleaned_google-final.csv

2. Put those files in the directory "files/Wine/"

3. Run main.py with the following arguments:
  a. "python main.py nb |response|" runs Naive Bayes on |response|, where |response| is one of "varietal",
  "country", "price", "price_category", or "rating"
  b. "python main.py sentiment |response|" runs a linear regression of sentiment score against |response|
  c. "python main.py sentiment2 |response|" runs a linear regression of sentiment + price against |response|
  d. "python main.py bow |response| |dims|" runs a logistic regression of TFIDF-weighted features against
  |response|. SVD is used to reduce the number of dimensions to |dims|

NEURAL NETS

TO RUN THE CODE, YOU MUST HAVE DOWNLOADED AND PLACED IN FOLDERS WITH CORRESPONDING DIRECTIONS AS SPECIFIED IN CODE

DOWNLOAD:: GloVe Vectors: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

DATASETS - please download from this dropbox link and place in correct adjacent directory -
different datasets correspond to the different files because of the ways they were cleaned and organized to run more smoothly with code
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3x73hhdgyqt0odx/AAC0NZ0_QVYZbiLLREsaBPv8a?dl=0


There are 5 files related to the Neural Nets code:

wine-bidirectional-rating.py
wine-bidirectional-price.py
wine-bidirectional-price-segment.py
wine-bidirectional-country.py
wine-bidirectional-category.py

Each one runs the corresponding tests for rating, price. price(categorical by segment), country or origin, and the variety(category).

After each call, you must type in RNN, GRU, or LSTM to specify the type

For example, this call will run an LSTM

wine-bidirectional-rating.py LSTM

The prompt will ask for the name of the output files and confusion matrix (if categorial prediction)

You can also use debug mode by calling debug after the cell type
