Computing cross-validation errors for the TFIDF, Naive Bayes, and sentiment models:
- Download the following files from https://github.com/ndtsao/cs221-project/tree/master/files/Wine:
  1. reds.csv
  2. whites.csv
  3. wine_cleaned_google-final.csv
- Put those files in the directory "files/Wine/" relative to main.py
- Run main.py with the following arguments:
  1. "python main.py nb |response|" runs Naive Bayes on |response|, where |response| is one of "varietal",
  "country", "price", "price_category", or "rating"
  2. "python main.py sentiment |response|" runs a linear regression of sentiment score against |response|
  3. "python main.py sentiment2 |response|" runs a linear regression of sentiment + price against |response|
  4. "python main.py bow |response| |dims|" runs a logistic regression of TFIDF-weighted features against
  |response|. SVD is used to reduce the number of dimensions to |dims|
